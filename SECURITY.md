- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project:

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Follow secure coding practices
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Never commit API keys, passwords, or tokens
- Review code changes for security implications

Given that this project is primarily Visual Basic .NET, consider the following:

- Be mindful of potential buffer overflows when handling strings.
- Properly sanitize user inputs to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
- Utilize parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection.
- Review the use of `unsafe` code blocks carefully.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions.
4. Release new versions as soon as possible.
