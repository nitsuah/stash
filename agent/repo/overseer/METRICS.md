| Health Score  | 95/100     | Overseer's own score                      |
| Last Updated  | 2026-05-23 | Docker test/audit refresh                 |

## Verification

- Coverage command: `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm coverage`
- Docker build smoke test: `docker build -t overseer-devops-check .`
- Production image note: the Docker build now uses placeholder auth values only during the build stage; runtime containers still require real auth secrets.

<!--
AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Update these metrics regularly (e.g., before a merge/last commit weekly or after major releases).
2. Use automated tools to fetch values where possible.
3. Keep this file focused on actual project metrics, not feature documentation.
4. For feature status tracking, see docs/AUDIT.md
5. For health score component breakdown, see FEATURES.md
