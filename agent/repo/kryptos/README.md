Inspired by *The Unexplained* with William Shatner, I set out to solve Kryptos using Python! This project focuses on
implementing cryptographic techniques, specifically the Vigenère cipher and structural transposition analysis, to
decrypt the famous Kryptos sculpture.

## TL;DR

This Kryptos repository is a research toolkit for exploring layered cipher hypotheses (Vigenère, Hill, transposition,
masking, and related hybrids) with an emphasis on reproducible pipelines and scoring heuristics.

## Autonomous Quickstart

Run a standard autonomous cycle:

```bash
python -m kryptos.cli.main autonomous --max-hours 24 --cycle-interval 5
```

Contributor operating standards and workflow expectations are consolidated in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.


## Repository Structure

The repository is organized for clarity, reproducibility, and future migration to a database-backed architecture. Key folders and files:

- **artifacts/**: Runtime outputs, logs, reports, and temporary artifacts (not git-tracked; will eventually migrate to DB, but required for now)
- **config/**: Configuration files (config.json, subfolders for meta_coordinator, ops_strategy, etc.). Consider moving root-level config/test/lint files here if tool support allows.
- **data/**: Static resources for scoring and analysis (n-gram tables, ciphertext, etc.). Will be replaced by DB in 2027.
- **docs/**: All documentation, analysis, reference, and archive. May migrate to DB for dynamic docs in the future, but static docs remain valuable.
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for linting, cleanup, and testing. To be audited and centralized for reusability.
- **src/**: Main source code. To be reorganized after other cleanup.
- **tests/**: Test suite. Reorganization planned after repo cleanup.
- **Root files**: Project metadata, requirements, Docker, and key documentation. Some config/test/lint files may move to config/ if supported.

**Planned migrations:**
- Data and artifacts will move to a database as part of 2027 work.
- Documentation may be dynamically served from a DB in the future.


Kryptos is a long-horizon cryptanalysis program, not a promise machine.

### What We Optimize For

1. **Truth over narrative**
  - We prefer uncomfortable results over comforting stories.
  - "Did it improve validated signal?" is the first question.

1. **Reproducibility over heroics**
  - Every claim should be backed by deterministic commands, artifacts, and provenance.
  - If a result cannot be reproduced, it does not count.

1. **Known-cipher reliability before unknown-cipher ambition**
  - K1-K3 performance is the quality gate for K4 campaigns.
  - We do not scale strategies that fail on validated baselines.

1. **AI as amplifier, not oracle**
  - AI accelerates hypothesis generation, coding, and experiment operations.
  - AI output is always treated as a proposal that must survive measurement.

1. **Small, compounding iterations**
  - Prefer narrow changes with clear acceptance criteria.
  - Ship improvements that make the next experiment faster and cleaner.

1. **Kill weak hypotheses quickly**
  - Retire approaches that repeatedly underperform controls.
  - Preserve a decision trail so retired ideas are not re-litigated without new evidence.

### Operating Commitments

- Every significant change includes a validation path (tests, benchmark deltas, or reproducible artifact evidence).
- Every campaign run writes traceable outputs under `artifacts/`.
- Every roadmap claim ties to measurable criteria, not adjectives.
- Every phase includes at least one explicit "stop doing" decision.

**K4 is the last unsolved piece of a CIA sculpture puzzle.** Imagine a secret message carved in copper that nobody has
cracked in 30+ years. We're using Python to systematically try every reasonable decryption method – techniques that
crypto analysts may have attempted manually but couldn't exhaustively explore. Our approach combines automated testing
with intelligent scoring to measure how "English-like" each result appears:

1. **Hill Cipher** - Matrix-based substitution where letters become numbers, transform through matrix multiplication,
then convert back.

1. **Transposition** - Systematic letter rearrangement (write in columns, read in rows, or more complex patterns)

1. **Masking** - Identifying and removing dummy letters that serve as padding or obfuscation

1. **Berlin Clock** - Using the iconic clock's binary time pattern as a cryptographic key

1. **Combo Attacks** - Chaining multiple methods together (K4 likely uses 2-3 techniques layered in sequence)

  - We evaluate candidates using linguistic patterns – common letter pairs, trigram frequencies, real word detection – to identify promising decryptions. Think of it as trying thousands of lock combinations, but guided by cryptanalytic intuition rather than brute force. After all, humans design puzzles with intention, not randomness!

## Recent Updates

### Phase 6 Comprehensive Cleanup (October 2025)

**Code Optimization**: Removed **3,554 lines** of unnecessary code while preserving all functionality

- Automated cleanup: -2,877 lines (docstrings, comments, verbose logging) across 65 files
- Deprecated code removal: -677 lines (unused configs, obsolete tests)
- Fixed K3 ciphertext correction (336 chars)

**Test Suite Optimization**: 633 collected (**631 fast-selected** / 10 slow tests gated by `KRYPTOS_RUN_SLOW_MONTE_CARLO` / 2 deselected in fast run mode)

- Added `@pytest.mark.slow` to long-running statistical validation tests
- Fast iteration: `pytest -m "not slow"` currently runs 631 tests in ~45-60s on a typical dev machine
- Slow Monte Carlo modules are opt-in via `KRYPTOS_RUN_SLOW_MONTE_CARLO=1` and can be run directly in CI or locally when needed

**Result**: Leaner codebase, faster development cycle, maintained 100% test pass rate

## Current Progress

### ✅ K1: "Between subtle shading and the absence of light lies the nuance of iqlusion"

- **Status**: Solved.
- **Details**: Decrypted via Vigenère using keyed alphabet `KRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZ`. Intentional misspelling preserved: `IQLUSION`.

### ✅ K2: "It was totally invisible. How's that possible?"

- **Status**: Solved.
- **Details**: Vigenère (key: `ABSCISSA`). Includes embedded null/structural padding (`S`) for historical alignment. Contains geospatial coordinates and narrative text.

### ✅ K3: "Slowly, desperately slowly, the remains of passage debris..."

- **Status**: Solved (double rotational transposition method).
- **Details**: Implemented the documented 24×14 grid → 90° rotation → reshape to 8-column grid → second 90° rotation. Resulting plaintext matches known solution including deliberate misspelling `DESPARATLY` (analogous
to `IQLUSION` in K1).

### ℹ️ K4: The unsolved mystery

- **Status**: Unsolved.
- **Implemented Toolkit**: See K4 modules below (Hill cipher exploration, scoring, constraint pipeline, multi-stage fusion).

- **Latest Additions**: Multi-crib positional transposition stage, attempt logging & persistence,

advanced linguistic metrics, 3x3 Hill key pruning (partial_len/partial_min tunable in hill constraint stage).

## Deliberate Misspellings / Anomalies

| Section | Cipher Plaintext Form | Expected Modern Spelling | Note |
|---------|-----------------------|---------------------------|------|
| K1      | IQLUSION              | ILLUSION                  | Intentional artistic alteration |
| K3      | DESPARATLY            | DESPERATELY               | Preserved from sculpture transcription |

### K2 Structural Padding

K2 contains systematic X (and some Y) insertions serving as alignment/null separators rather than mistakes. They should
be treated as structural artifacts when analyzing pattern continuity or constructing transposition hypotheses.

## K4 Analysis Toolkit (New / Updated Modules)

Located under `kryptos/k4/` (migrated from `src/k4/`):

See `docs/reference/API_REFERENCE.md` for code-level API documentation.

## Roadmap

See `ROADMAP.md` for the current roadmap and milestones.

## CLI Usage Examples

The `kryptos` CLI aggregates decryption, tuning, and SPY analysis workflows. Use `kryptos --help` to view all
subcommands. Below are common end‑to‑end examples.

### List Sections

```bash
kryptos sections
```

### Composite K4 Decrypt

Decrypt K4 ciphertext from a file, limit candidates, enable adaptive fusion, and write artifacts:

```bash
kryptos k4-decrypt --cipher data/k4_cipher.txt --limit 40 --adaptive --report
```

Outputs JSON containing top plaintext, score, lineage, and artifact paths. Artifacts (candidates, attempts) are written
under `artifacts/` when `--report` is used.

### Persist Attempt Logs

Flush in-memory attempt logs to a timestamped JSON file:

```bash
kryptos k4-attempts --label k4
```

### Tuning: Crib Weight Sweep

Run a sweep across candidate weights for optional cribs and samples:

```bash
kryptos tuning-crib-weight-sweep --weights 0.25,0.5,1.0,1.5 \
  --cribs BERLIN,CLOCK \
  --samples data/holdout_samples.txt --json
```

Emits JSON rows: each weight with baseline vs with‑crib deltas.

Select best performing weight from a prior sweep CSV:

```bash
kryptos tuning-pick-best --csv artifacts/tuning_runs/run_20251023T120000/crib_weight_sweep.csv
```

Clean and summarize a tuning run directory (crib hit counts, aggregates). Writes artifacts unless `--no-write` is
provided:

### Tuning: Tiny Param Sweep

Deterministic miniature parameter sweep (debug/demo):

```bash
kryptos tuning-tiny-param-sweep
```

### Tuning: Holdout Score

Compute mean scoring deltas for a chosen crib weight over representative holdout samples:

```bash
kryptos tuning-holdout-score --weight 1.25 --out artifacts/reports/holdout.csv
```

Use `--no-write` to skip CSV output and only print JSON.

### SPY Evaluation

Evaluate extraction confidence thresholds against labeled runs:

```bash
kryptos spy-eval --labels data/spy_eval_labels.csv --runs artifacts/tuning_runs --thresholds 0.10,0.25,0.40,0.55
```

Outputs precision/recall/F1 per threshold plus `best_threshold`.

### SPY Extraction

Extract SPY tokens at minimum confidence from all run_* directories:

```bash
kryptos spy-extract --runs artifacts/tuning_runs --min-conf 0.30
```

Returns mapping of run directory → extracted tokens.

### End‑to‑End Flow (Example)

```bash
cp data/k4_cipher.txt work_cipher.txt
kryptos k4-decrypt --cipher work_cipher.txt --limit 50 --adaptive --report > decrypt.json
kryptos k4-attempts --label k4
kryptos tuning-crib-weight-sweep --weights 0.5,1.0,1.5 --cribs BERLIN,CLOCK --json > sweep.json
# Assume sweep CSV written separately; pick best
kryptos tuning-pick-best --csv artifacts/tuning_runs/run_*/crib_weight_sweep.csv
kryptos tuning-holdout-score --weight 1.0 --no-write > holdout.json
kryptos spy-eval --labels data/spy_eval_labels.csv --runs artifacts/tuning_runs --thresholds 0.0,0.25,0.5,0.75 > spy_eval.json
kryptos spy-extract --runs artifacts/tuning_runs --min-conf 0.25 > spy_tokens.json
```

You now have: decrypt.json, sweep.json, holdout.json, spy_eval.json, spy_tokens.json summarizing the pipeline, tuning,
and extraction outputs.

## RAG API (turbovec)

A lightweight FastAPI app provides semantic search over `artifacts/` (decisions, hypotheses, logs, reports), backed by
a [turbovec](https://pypi.org/project/turbovec/) compressed vector index and `sentence-transformers` embeddings.

Start the server:

```bash
kryptos serve --port 8000
```

Build (or rebuild) the index from the current `artifacts/` contents — required before searching, and after any
`artifacts/` changes:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/rag/reindex
```

Check index status:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/api/rag/status
```

Semantic search:

```bash
curl "localhost:8000/api/rag/search?q=Hill+cipher+key+matrix&k=5"
```

Health check:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/health
```

The index is stored under `data/turbovec/` (gitignored, derived from `artifacts/`).

## Recent Changes

- **2025-10-24**: Fixed CI failures by correcting `.gitignore` pattern - added agents source code (SPY, OPS, Q agents)

that was previously blocked

- **2025-10-22**: Added offline autopilot flow (Q/OPS/SPY), conservative SPY extractor with evaluation harness, demo

smoke CI and packaging improvements. See `docs/AUTOPILOT.md` for details

## Autopilot (Q / OPS / SPY) Summary

The repository includes an offline autopilot flow (Q / OPS / SPY) to recommend and execute safe tuning and extraction
steps. `ask_triumverate.py` implements a lightweight driver that can run a deterministic OPS tuning sweep and then
invoke the conservative SPY extractor. If `SPY_MIN_CONF` is not set, the autopilot will compute a conservative threshold
using the evaluation harness; it falls back to `0.25` when no labeled runs are available. See
`docs/reference/AGENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md` for full details and CLI examples.

## Contributing

Contribution guidelines moved to `CONTRIBUTING.md` → [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Docker Fast Coverage

Run the fast test suite with coverage in a lightweight Docker container:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/app" -w /app python:3.13-slim sh -lc \
  "pip install --no-cache-dir pytest pytest-cov numpy matplotlib requests beautifulsoup4 spacy nltk pyyaml fastapi httpx && \
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm && \
   pip install --no-cache-dir -e . --no-deps && \
   pytest tests/ -m 'not slow' --cov=src --cov-report=term"
```

Note: `tests/test_k4_performance.py` contains a micro-benchmark guard that is automatically skipped in container
environments to avoid false regressions from container scheduling variance.

## Scoring Metrics Snapshot

Use `baseline_stats(text)` to inspect metrics including advanced linguistic features.

## Data Sources

Frequency & n-gram data in `data/` (TSV). High-quality quadgrams loaded automatically if `quadgrams_high_quality.tsv`
exists. Fallback unigram distribution used if files absent.

## License

See `LICENSE`.

## Code Examples

If you prefer to run an example pipeline, use the example script:

```bash
python -m kryptos.examples.sections_demo
```

Or invoke the composite K4 search directly:

```python
from kryptos.k4 import decrypt_best
result = decrypt_best(K4_CIPHERTEXT, limit=40, adaptive=True)
print(result.plaintext, result.score)
```

Minimal lower-level pipeline construction (for experimentation):

```python
from kryptos.k4.pipeline import (
  make_hill_constraint_stage,
  make_masking_stage,
  make_transposition_adaptive_stage,
  make_transposition_stage,
  Pipeline,
)
from kryptos.k4.composite import run_composite_pipeline

stages = [
  make_masking_stage(limit=20),
  make_transposition_adaptive_stage(),
  make_transposition_stage(),
  make_hill_constraint_stage(partial_len=50, partial_min=-850.0),
]
out = run_composite_pipeline(K4_CIPHERTEXT, stages, report=False, limit=30, adaptive=True)
print(out['aggregated'][0]['text'])
```

### Artifact Layout

Pipeline-generated run directories may be grouped under an optional subdirectory for clarity:

```text
artifacts/
  k4_runs/          # pipeline executor runs (run_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS when artifact_run_subdir is set)
  tuning_runs/      # tuning/daemon sweep runs (run_*)
  reports/          # reporting outputs (top candidates, aggregated attempts) (now under artifacts/)
  decisions/        # autopilot / plan artifacts (JSON summaries)
  logs/             # runtime / diagnostic logs
  output/           # miscellaneous generated outputs / crib extracts
```

Enable grouping by passing `artifact_run_subdir="k4_runs"` to `PipelineConfig`. If you have legacy `artifacts/run_*`
directories from older versions, migrate them safely with:

```bash
python scripts/dev/migrate_run_artifacts.py --dry-run
python scripts/dev/migrate_run_artifacts.py
```

If no legacy directories are present, the script reports that there is nothing to move.
