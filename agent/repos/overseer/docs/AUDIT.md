# Overseer Feature Audit

Last Updated: August 9, 2026

## Summary

Documentation and implementation are aligned across the project. Key validations:

- **Test Coverage**: Docker-validated via `docker compose -f config/docker-compose.test.yml run --rm coverage`. 31 test files, 447 tests (446 passing, 1 skipped Gemini health check without API key). Coverage numbers may vary; rerun to get current statement/branch/function/line percentages.
- **Production OAuth**: Verified working on Netlify (NextAuth v5 + GitHub OAuth) — no longer a blocker.
- **AI / Gemini**: Multi-provider failover (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude) with auto-discovery, hot model swapping, and BYOK provider-order routing shipped (Q4 2025–Q1 2026) — see HANDOFF-byok-quota-provider-fallback-20260411.
- **Community Standards**: All 10 standards have templates and modal-based PR creation ✅
- **Documentation**: All 5 core docs (ROADMAP, TASKS, METRICS, FEATURES, README) have templates and modal-based PR creation ✅
- **Best Practices**: 4 of 10 template-based practices (Dependabot, Env Template, Docker, Netlify Badge) have modal-based PR creation ✅
- Centralized server-side logging via `lib/log.ts`; server routes and scripts use `logger` consistently.
- `.env.example` exists and is referenced in README and CONTRIBUTING; Dependabot and Docker are configured.
- **Security Enhancement**: Markdown rendering uses react-markdown with rehype-sanitize plugin for XSS protection ✅
- **Authentication UI**: Sync All button restricted to authenticated users only ✅
- **Docker Validation**: `docker build -t overseer-devops-check .` completes without real secrets injected at build time; runtime secrets are still required ✅

## Feature Detection & Display Matrix

This matrix shows what Overseer tracks, how we detect it, health indicators, and automated fixes.

Modal-based fixes are reflected directly in the "Automated Fix" column (e.g., "✅ Modal").

### Legend

**Detection Method:**

- File existence: Check if file is present
- Pattern matching: Search for patterns in filenames
- Parsing: Parse file content and extract structured data
- GitHub API: Query GitHub REST API

**Source:**

- GitHub API: Direct from GitHub
- File list scan: Scan repository file tree
- Self-reported: From METRICS.md or similar
- Composite: Calculated from multiple sources

**Health Indicator:**

- 4-state: Missing, Dormant, Malformed, Healthy
- 3-state: Missing, Dormant, Healthy
- Binary: Healthy or Missing
- Percentage: 0-100% score
- Count: Numeric count
- Color-coded: Visual indicator based on thresholds
- git-workflow (Pass/Fail/Unknown with workflow name)

**Automated Fix:**

- ✅ Template PR: Create PR with template file
- ✅ Regenerate: Re-run generation
- ❌ No: No automated fix available
- N/A: Not applicable

**Status:**

- ✅: Fully implemented and displayed
- ⚠️ Partial: Implemented but not fully integrated
- ❌ Missing: Not implemented

## 🔴 Remaining Gaps

Sourced from ROADMAP.md / TASKS.md (updated 2026-08-09).

### 1. Best Practices Fix Modal (Currently 4 of 10)

Current: 4 best practices have Fix buttons with modal preview — Dependabot ✅, .env.example ✅, Docker ✅, Netlify Badge ✅.

Tracked but no Fix buttons (6 remaining): CI/CD configuration, Pre-commit Hooks, Linting configuration, Branch Protection, Testing Framework, .gitignore.

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Would complete automated fix coverage for best practices

### 2. AI-Enhanced Community Standards (Dogfooding)

Overseer tracks these but doesn't have them itself at root. Could use AI to generate personalized versions:

- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (exists in templates/ only)
- SECURITY.md (exists in templates/ only)
- Issue Templates (exists in templates/ only)
- PR Template (not present in overseer root)

**Priority**: LOW - Templates exist, just need to apply them to overseer itself

### 3. Security Configuration Tracking

Still tracked but not yet fully surfaced in the UI:

- Security policy presence tracking
- Security advisory configuration
- Private vulnerability reporting status

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Would complete the security visibility story

### 4. Cross-Repo Orchestration (Planned)

Agent dispatch bridge to agent-board, cross-repo dependency mapping, and chat-driven TASKS/ROADMAP management.

**Priority**: Planned - Q3 2026 candidate

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

**Next Priority Items**:

1. Expand the Best Practices Fix Modal to the remaining 6 checks (gap #1).
2. Apply community standards templates to overseer itself (gap #2).
3. Surface remaining security policy fields in the UI (gap #3).
4. Scope Q3 2026 cross-repo orchestration and conversational interface (gap #4).
