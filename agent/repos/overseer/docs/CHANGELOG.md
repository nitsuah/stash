# Changelog

All notable changes to Overseer will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Roadmap-to-DEV-flow handoff linkage:** Roadmap items can now be linked to a tracked PR and/or an Agent Task Queue entry via `PATCH /api/repos/[name]/roadmap-items/[id]`. Linked PRs and agent tasks are shown as badges in the per-repo roadmap progress view, with an inline edit/clear control available to authenticated users directly from the dashboard. `lib/sync.ts` now merges (rather than delete+inserts) `roadmap_items` so these DB-only links survive re-syncs
- **Centralized Gemini Model Discovery:** New `gemini-model-discovery.ts` module provides single source of truth for model configuration
- **Auto-Discovery Fallback:** Automatically searches for working models when configured model fails (tries version 3, 2.5, 2.0, then pro models)
- **Model Caching:** Discovered working models are cached for 1 hour to reduce API calls
- **Unified Environment Variables:** Aligned all code to use `GEMINI_MODEL_NAME` (or `GEMINI_MODEL` as fallback) consistently

### Changed

- **Repo-detail query batching:** `GET /api/repo-details/[name]` now fetches all seven per-repo detail tables (tasks, roadmap_items, metrics, features, doc_status, best_practices, community_standards) in a single `db.transaction([...])` call instead of seven sequential round trips, reducing per-repo load latency by ~7×
- **Default Model Updated:** Changed from deprecated `models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp` to `models/gemini-2.5-flash` (current working model as of Feb 2026)
- **Model Configuration:** All files now import from centralized `gemini-model-discovery` instead of hardcoding strings
- **AI Failover Integration:** Integrated new discovery system with existing failover logic
- **Test Model Candidates:** Updated `test-model-names.mjs` with future-proof version 3 models for when Google releases them

### Fixed

- **Model String Duplication:** Eliminated hardcoded model strings across multiple files
- **Environment Variable Inconsistency:** Fixed discrepancy between `GEMINI_MODEL` and `GEMINI_MODEL_NAME` usage
- **Health Check Accuracy:** Health endpoint now uses same model as actual generation code
