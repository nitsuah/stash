# Handoff: Agent Task Queue Execution (2026-04-03)

## Summary
Implemented the Agent Task Queue execution path in the API route so submitted tasks are queued, processed, and queryable by status.

## What Changed
- Implemented in-memory queue runtime in `app/api/agent/tasks/route.ts`.
- Added task lifecycle states: `queued`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`.
- Added authenticated `GET /api/agent/tasks?id=<taskId>` to retrieve a single task.
- Added authenticated `GET /api/agent/tasks` to retrieve all tasks and status summary counts.
- Preserved existing POST validation and auth checks for task submission.
- Added/updated tests in `tests/agent-tasks.test.ts` for:
  - execution lifecycle visibility,
  - GET single-task retrieval,
  - GET list + summary,
  - GET auth and 404 behaviors.

## Validation
- Docker-focused test run:
  - `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm test npx vitest run tests/agent-tasks.test.ts`
  - Result: 15 passed, 0 failed.

## Notes
- Queue processing is intentionally in-memory for now and resets on process restart.
- Next logical hardening step is persistent queue storage with retry/backoff semantics.
