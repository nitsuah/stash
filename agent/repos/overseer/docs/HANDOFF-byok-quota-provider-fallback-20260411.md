## HANDOFF BRIEF

Date: 2026-04-11
Repo: nitsuah/overseer
Agent: GitHub Copilot

### Active Task

Gemini model evolution and reliability — ready for review

### Completed This Session

- Created branch feat/byok-quota-provider-fallback and implemented provider routing controls.
- Removed hardcoded Gemini-first provider behavior by adding AI_PROVIDER_ORDER support.
- Added BYOK key precedence for Gemini, OpenAI, and Anthropic.
- Added quota-aware Gemini deprioritization toggles for operational failover.
- Added unit tests for provider ordering, BYOK precedence, and quota-based routing.
- Updated environment and roadmap/task docs to reflect shipped reliability work.

### Blockers

- No active code blocker.
- Optional follow-up: wire runtime quota detection to auto-toggle GEMINI_QUOTA_EXCEEDED without manual env changes.

### Decisions

- Kept implementation env-driven to avoid introducing per-user secret persistence in this pass.
- Added provider-order controls in a single source of truth (`lib/ai-providers.ts`) so all failover paths inherit behavior.

### Files Changed

- lib/ai-providers.ts: added provider order parsing, BYOK key resolution, and quota-based Gemini deprioritization.
- tests/gemini-health.test.ts: added coverage for default/custom order, BYOK precedence, and quota fallback ordering.
- .env.example: documented BYOK and provider routing env variables.
- README.md: documented failover routing and BYOK env controls.
- TASKS.md: recorded completed reliability improvement.
- ROADMAP.md: recorded completed Q2 reliability sub-milestone.

### Next Action

Run full test and lint suite in Docker, then open a PR with this handoff attached and request PMO review for closing the Gemini reliability sub-task.
