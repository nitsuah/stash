# Project Metrics: agent-board

This document tracks the health, performance, and quality metrics of the `agent-board` project.

## Core Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit Test Coverage** | 81.10% statements / 71.39% branches / 89.83% functions (native run 2026-09-11 — no Docker in this cloud automation environment — `npm run test:coverage` in `dashboard/` with NODE_V8_COVERAGE + c8; 66/66 unit tests pass, 0 failures) | >80% | 🟢 |
| **Test File Count** | 70 test files (66 unit + 4 e2e requiring a live LLM/Docker stack); 66/66 unit tests pass natively (2026-09-11) | >50 | 🟢 |
| **Critical Vulnerabilities** | 0 | 0 | 🟢 |
| **ESLint Errors** | 0 | 0 | 🟢 |
| **Avg. Cyclomatic Complexity** | TBD | <10 | ⚪ |
| **Production Bundle Size** | TBD | <500KB | ⚪ |
| **CI Build Time** | TBD | <3 mins | ⚪ |
| **CI Pipeline Success Rate** | TBD | 100% | ⚪ |
| **Outdated Dependencies** | TBD | 0 | ⚪ |
| **Lines of Code (LOC)** | TBD | N/A | ⚪ |

## Metric Definitions

*   **Unit Test Coverage:** Percentage of code branches and lines executed during test suites.
*   **Test File Count:** Number of test files run by the suite (not individual test cases/assertions within them).
*   **Critical Vulnerabilities:** High or Critical security issues reported by `npm audit`.
*   **ESLint Errors:** Number of breaking linting violations based on the local configuration.
*   **Avg. Cyclomatic Complexity:** The average number of linearly independent paths through the source code.
*   **Production Bundle Size:** The minified and gzipped size of the final JavaScript distribution.
*   **CI Build Time:** The wall-clock time from commit trigger to successful deployment/artifact.
*   **Outdated Dependencies:** Number of packages with available major updates.

## How to Update

Run the following commands to generate current values for this table:

### 1. Test Count
```bash
# Unit + integration/e2e test run inside Docker
docker compose run --rm agent-dashboard npm run test
```

### 2. Coverage
```bash
# Coverage baseline from the dashboard image (Docker path)
docker compose run --rm agent-dashboard npm run test:coverage

# Native path (no host Docker required) — run from dashboard/
cd dashboard && npm install && npm run test:coverage
```

Current coverage baseline (native run 2026-09-11, `npm run test:coverage`
inside `dashboard/` with NODE_V8_COVERAGE + c8, in a cloud automation
environment without Docker access — no `docker compose` wrapper used).
c8 v8 report over a clean 66/66 unit run. Measured, not estimated.

**All files: 81.10% statements / 71.39% branches / 89.83% functions.**

Essentially flat versus the 2026-09-04 Docker baseline (81.53% / 72.68% /
90.39%) — the small (~0.4-1.3pt) differences are consistent with c8/v8's
usual run-to-run noise rather than a real coverage change; no production
code changed shape this cycle. This also confirms the native and Docker
paths produce equivalent results for this repo's dashboard test suite.

Strongest:
- `safety.js` 99%, `mcp-helpers.js` 100%, `logger.js` 100%
- `plugins.js` 99%, `sessions.js` 95%, `worktrees.js` 95%, `channels.js` 96%
- `plugin-loader.js` 96%, `endpoints.js` 95%, `metrics.js` 92%, `webhooks.js` 92%
- `agent-tools.js` 84%

Remaining gaps, and why:
- `persistence.js` 46% — the uncovered half is live Postgres I/O; the no-op
  path when `DATABASE_URL` is unset is covered. Needs a database to go higher.
- `tracing.js` 56% — uncovered code is OpenTelemetry SDK wiring that only runs
  with `OTEL_ENABLED=true` and a collector endpoint.
- `docker.js` 64% — uncovered branches shell out to the Docker CLI/daemon.
- `content.js` 37% — reads generated client/artifact output directories that do
  not exist in a test container.
- `session-message.js` 43% and `session-stream.js` 69% — the remainder is
  long-running streaming and stall-timeout behavior (30s timers).
- `workspace.js` 71% — the rest is `/workspace/exec` and git push/remote paths.

These are integration-shaped rather than untested logic; raising them further
means standing up Postgres, a collector, and a Docker daemon in CI rather than
writing more unit tests.

### 3. Security Audit
```bash
npm audit
```

### 4. Code Quality & Linting
```bash
# Linting
npm run lint

# Complexity (using plato or eslint-plugin-complexity)
npx eslint . --format json
```

### 5. Bundle Size
```bash
# After build
npm run build
du -sh ./dist # or ./build
```

### 6. Dependency Freshness
```bash
npm outdated
```

### 7. Lines of Code
```bash
# Requires cloc installed
cloc . --exclude-dir=node_modules,dist
```
