# Agent Board Short Demo Script (60-75s)

## Purpose
A short-form version of the main demo designed for quick sharing on X, LinkedIn, and YouTube Shorts while preserving the core proof points.

## Recording Notes
- Reuse the same footage flow as the 2-minute script.
- Keep cuts tight; avoid waiting on long model output.
- If needed, record at 1080p and export both 16:9 and 9:16 crops.
