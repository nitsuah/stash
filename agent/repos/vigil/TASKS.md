## In Progress

## Todo

### P0 - Critical

_None open — P0 hardening shipped in #225/#226 (see CHANGELOG)._

### P1 - High

_None open — see CHANGELOG for the #221–#233 work._

### P2 - Medium

- [x] **[2027-Q1]** Chat-driven doc editing (TASKS/ROADMAP/FEATURES) — stages 1–4 complete.
  - Priority: P2
  - Context: the per-repo chat panel (PR #196) only answered questions before this branch — it rebuilt context and replied, but couldn't act.
  - Acceptance Criteria: broken into stages — (1) chat can propose a specific, diffable edit to one doc file and show it inline before applying; (2) accepting the proposal opens a PR via the existing fix-doc PR flow rather than writing directly; (3) the chat can check an item off in TASKS.md or move it to FEATURES.md when the user confirms it's shipped, referencing the same parser the dashboard already uses so state never diverges from what's rendered elsewhere; (4) before calling `createPrForFile`, the caller-supplied target path must be validated against the approved doc list (TASKS.md/ROADMAP.md/FEATURES.md, matching the existing `TARGET_PATHS` mapping) — never pass a chat-supplied path straight through unchecked.
  - Status: ✅ ALL STAGES (1)–(4) COMPLETE — `parseTaskOperationProposal` in `lib/repo-chat.ts` extracts fenced ` ```proposal``` ` JSON for task operations (check_off, move_to_features, move_to_roadmap, update_status, add_task); `RepoChatPanel` renders task proposals as inline cards with Apply/Dismiss; Apply calls new `POST /api/repos/[name]/tasks` which fetches TASKS.md, applies the operation using `parseTasks`/`serializeTasks`, creates PR via `createPrForFile`, and for cross-file moves also updates FEATURES.md/ROADMAP.md in additional PRs; all validated against `TARGET_PATHS`.
  - Done 2026-09-25: All four stages shipped via PRs #234–#237.

- [x] Ship the cross-repo relationship map foundation: `repo_relationships`, `/api/relationships`, `get_relationships` / `propose_relationship` MCP tools, PMO map.
  - Priority: P2
  - Done 2026-09-25: Foundation shipped in PR #238.

- [ ] Grow the cross-repo relationship map from real evidence.
  - Priority: P2
  - Next: (1) seed the real edges (confirm or reject what agents propose); (2) an Obsidian import that reads relationship lines from the vault and posts them to `POST /api/relationships` as proposals; (3) a PMO audit / agent pass that proposes edges from real evidence (package.json deps, MCP/API URLs in config, deploy scripts); (4) surface "what depends on this repo" on the repo details panel.
  - Acceptance Criteria: the map reflects real usage for every tracked repo, and agents consult `get_relationships` before cross-repo changes.

- [ ] **[2027-Q1]** 3D / click-to-detail view of the relationship map, once the 2D map's data is right.
  - Priority: P3

- [x] Thread `full_name` through to the trend endpoint instead of matching by short `name`.
  - Priority: P2
  - Context: flagged by CodeRabbit on PR #204 (2026-09-09) — `GET /api/repo-details/[name]/trend` matches `repos.name`, which is ambiguous if two tracked repos across different owners share a short name. `repo.full_name` is already available at every call site (`RepoTableRow.tsx`, `MobileRepoCard.tsx`) but isn't threaded through `ExpandableRow` -> `RepositoryStatsSectionStatic` -> the trend fetch URL. Deferred rather than rushed since it touches three component layers.
  - Acceptance Criteria: the trend route (and its callers) key on `full_name` or `repo_id`, not the bare `name` column; add a regression test with two same-named repos under different owners.
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETE (2026-09-28) — `app/api/repo-details/[name]/trend/route.ts` accepts `fullName` query param; `components/repo-details/RepositoryStatsSectionStatic.tsx` extracts `full_name` from `repoUrl` and passes it. Shipped in PR #253.
  - Done 2026-09-28: PR #253 merged.

### DB & backend scaling

- [x] Give every authenticated session a stable rate-limiter identity, not just `session.user.email`.
  - Priority: P2
  - Context: flagged by CodeRabbit on PR #211 (2026-09-11) — the entire shared-key reservation block in `app/api/repos/[name]/chat/route.ts` is gated on `session?.user?.email`. GitHub's OAuth profile can return a null email (an account with no public/verified email), in which case that gate is skipped entirely and the request proceeds through `generateAIContent` with **no shared-key rate limiting or budget at all** — a full bypass, not just a narrow edge case. Confirmed this gate predates PR #211 (the original process-local-`Map` code had the identical `if (session?.user?.email)` condition), so it's a pre-existing gap PR #211 didn't introduce — not fixed inline because it touches `auth.ts`/session-shape internals (does NextAuth's JWT session reliably expose a stable non-email id like `token.sub` on `session.user`? not currently wired up) and deserves its own scoped change + tests rather than a rushed edit alongside an already-large rate-limiter PR.
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETE (2026-09-28) — `session.userId` is now the stable GitHub numeric id captured at sign-in (`lib/auth-session.ts`). Updated `app/api/repos/[name]/chat/route.ts`, `app/api/settings/ai-key/route.ts`, `app/api/agent/tasks/route.ts` to use `session.userId` as primary identifier with email as fallback. Route test for authenticated session with no email passes (22 tests in `repo-chat-api.test.ts`).
  - Acceptance Criteria: every authenticated session has a stable identifier available to the rate limiter — `session.userId` (GitHub's numeric id) as primary, with email as fallback — so no authenticated session can reach `generateAIContent` without being subject to either the shared-key budget or an explicit user-provided-credentials exemption. Route test covering an authenticated session with no email.
  - Done 2026-09-28: PR #254 merged.

### P3 - Exploratory

- [ ] Roll the visual-docs recipe out to tracked web-app repos, then score it.
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: `visual_docs` shipped informational-only (excluded via `INFORMATIONAL_PRACTICES` in `lib/visual-docs.ts`) so adding it didn't drop every repo's best-practices ratio at once. See docs/VISUAL_DOCS.md.
  - Acceptance Criteria: recipe adopted (workflow + script + README markers) in nitsuah-io, darkmoon, skyview, farm-3j, games; then remove `visual_docs` from `INFORMATIONAL_PRACTICES`, update the Health Score table in FEATURES.md, and add a Fix-PR template so the Best Practices panel can open the adoption PR in one click.

- [ ] Per-user API tokens for MCP / `/api/context`.
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: today a single shared `MCP_API_KEY` (Netlify env) is the only machine credential — fine while vigil has one owner (see docs/MCP.md). Once other people use vigil, each needs their own revocable key scoped to the repos they can access (a bearer key currently means full-portfolio admin).
  - Acceptance Criteria: `api_tokens` table storing only a hash, with `user_id`, `name`, `created_at`, `last_used_at`, `revoked_at`; tokens resolve to the owning user's `getAccessibleRepoIds` scope rather than full portfolio; a small Settings panel to create (shown once), list, and revoke; the shared `MCP_API_KEY` keeps working as the admin key.

- [ ] Add zombie-branch detection.
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: the UI does not yet surface stale long-lived branches.
  - Acceptance Criteria: stale branches are detected and flagged in the interface with a bulk-action dialog to delete selected branches (confirmation step, scaling across all repos); includes a "clean up hidden repos" action to safely purge DB cache for hidden/removed repos with a confirmation step noting the GH source is untouched.
  - Status: 🟡 PARTIAL (PMO audit 2026-09-24) — detection exists (`ZombieBranch` in `lib/github/repos.ts`, `zombie_branch_count` in `lib/db.ts`) and the count renders in `RepoTableRow.tsx` / `MobileRepoCard.tsx`. The bulk-delete dialog and the "clean up hidden repos" action from the acceptance criteria are not built yet.

- [ ] Add a dark and light mode toggle.
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: theme preferences are still not user-configurable.
  - Acceptance Criteria: the UI supports a persistent theme toggle.

- [ ] **[2027-Q1]** Add technical-debt trending (velocity scoring + trending shipped in PRs #200/#204).
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: commit frequency and PR merge time are captured but not yet trended over time.
  - Acceptance Criteria: a trend chart shows velocity and technical-debt signals over rolling quarters.
  - Status: 🟡 PARTIAL — velocity score (PR #200) via `calculateVelocityScore` in `lib/repo-signals.ts`; trending (PR #204) via a new `repo_snapshots` table recorded per sync (commit frequency, PR merge time, health score, open PRs, LOC), `GET /api/repo-details/[name]/trend`, and a health-score sparkline in `RepositoryStatsSectionStatic`. Technical-debt trending is still open (ROADMAP.md Portfolio Intelligence Batch note), so this stays unchecked.

- [ ] Agent session receipts.
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: new idea (2026-08-28) — AI Summaries describe a repo's state; nothing describes what an agent _did_ to it recently. Picking up mid-portfolio work today means reconstructing activity from commit messages and PR history by hand across every repo.
  - Acceptance Criteria: a lightweight per-repo activity log surfaced in both the chat panel and the PMO view, built on the existing dispatch/queue seams rather than a new schema — persist a `sessionId` (correlating with the `motorPoolSessionId` already returned by `motorPoolBridge.dispatch()` in `lib/agent-bridge.ts`), a `filesTouched` list, and a `skipReason` string (distinct from the `TaskQueueItem.error` field in `app/api/agent/tasks/route.ts`, which represents failures, not deliberate skips) alongside each task's existing `result`/`status` fields; commits and PRs opened/merged are sourced from GitHub data already synced via `lib/github/prs.ts`, no new write path required.

<!--
AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Keep active items in In Progress and P1-P3 sections.
2. Keep task bullets short and scannable.
3. Move finished work into FEATURES.md, not a Done section here.
