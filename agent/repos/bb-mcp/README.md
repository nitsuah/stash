A standalone [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server wrapping the Blackboard Learn REST API. Point any MCP-compatible client at it — Claude Desktop, Cursor, agent-board, or anything else — and get structured access to courses, grades, assignments, announcements, and more.

---

## Why standalone?

The integration logic lives here, not in the client. Tools like agent-board, Claude Desktop, and Cursor all connect the same way. Build it once, use it everywhere. Blackboard's own team could point internal tooling at this server without touching any frontend code.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # Fill in BB_CLIENT_ID, BB_CLIENT_SECRET, BB_BASE_URL
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## Development

All checks run via Docker — no local Node.js required.

```bash
# Run all tests (151 tests, TypeScript)
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml --profile test run --rm test

# Full quality gate: lint + coverage + audit + complexity
make docker-test

# Individual targets
make docker-lint    # lint only
make docker-build   # production image
```

**Pre-commit hooks** (type-check on commit, tests on push):
```bash
pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for the full CI pipeline.

## Makefile reference

```sh
make docker-up        # Build and start the standalone bb-mcp container
make docker-logs      # Follow container logs
make docker-doctor    # Safe env readiness report from inside the container
make docker-probe     # Validate Blackboard credentials + minimal API call
make docker-manifest  # Print the provider manifest from the built image
make docker-tools     # Print the published tool catalog from the built image
make docker-down      # Stop the standalone stack
```

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in BB_CLIENT_ID, BB_CLIENT_SECRET, BB_BASE_URL
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Repo-local standalone commands:

```bash
make docker-up        # Build and start the standalone bb-mcp container
make docker-logs      # Follow container logs
make docker-doctor    # Safe env readiness report from inside the container
make docker-probe     # Validate Blackboard credentials + minimal API call
make docker-manifest  # Print the provider manifest from the built image
make docker-tools     # Print the published tool catalog from the built image
make docker-down      # Stop the standalone stack
```

The standalone compose stack keeps the same Dockerfile path used by agent-board, but now adds a more confined runtime posture: read-only filesystem, dropped Linux capabilities, `no-new-privileges`, and a small `/tmp` tmpfs for Node runtime needs.

Server is live at `http://localhost:3100`.

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /mcp` | MCP protocol entry point |
| `GET /health` | Liveness probe |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus text format |
| `GET /manifest` | Provider contract with capabilities and tool manifest |
| `GET /oauth/authorize` | Start the OAuth Authorization Code flow |
| `GET /oauth/callback` | Complete OAuth code exchange and return a managed session |
| `GET /sse/search-course-materials` | Dedicated SSE stream for incremental `search_course_materials` output |

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev        # tsx watch — hot reload
```

### stdio mode (Claude Desktop / Cursor)

```bash
npm run build
node dist/index.js --stdio
```

### CLI inspection commands

```bash
# Show available runtime modes and inspection commands
node dist/index.js --help

# Print the provider manifest without starting the server
node dist/index.js --manifest

# List the published tools with role coverage
node dist/index.js --tools

# Emit a safe environment readiness report (no secrets printed)
node dist/index.js --doctor

# Validate Blackboard credentials and a minimal API call
node dist/index.js --probe
```

### Validating with MCP Inspector

```bash
npm run inspect
# or, via Docker (matches CI's build):
make docker-inspect
```

Both run the official [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) CLI's `tools/list` method over a real stdio handshake against `node dist/index.js --stdio`, using `config/mcp-inspector.config.example.json` (checked-in, placeholder credentials — Inspector spawns the server with a **sanitized environment that does not inherit your shell or `.env`**, so `BB_CLIENT_ID`/`BB_CLIENT_SECRET` must come from the config file's `env` block or repeated `-e KEY=value` flags; any non-empty values work here since this only validates the transport/protocol/schema layer, not a live Blackboard connection — see `--probe` above for that). Currently passes with **0 errors** (40 schema-portability warnings, all `caller_identity: {}` accepting any value — tracked separately in `TASKS.md` under "Add JSON schemas for all shipped tool inputs").

Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blackboard-learn": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/bb-mcp/dist/index.js", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BB_CLIENT_ID` | ✅ | OAuth2 app client ID from [developer.blackboard.com](https://developer.blackboard.com) |
| `BB_CLIENT_SECRET` | ✅ | OAuth2 app client secret |
| `BB_BASE_URL` | ✅ | Base URL of your Blackboard Learn instance |
| `BB_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` | — | Override the OAuth callback URL (defaults to `PUBLIC_BASE_URL + /oauth/callback`) |
| `BB_OAUTH_SCOPE` | — | Optional scope string for the authorization code flow |
| `BB_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_PATH` | — | Override Blackboard authorization endpoint path |
| `BB_OAUTH_TOKEN_PATH` | — | Override Blackboard token endpoint path |
| `PORT` | — | HTTP port (default `3100`) |
| `HOST` | — | Bind address (default `0.0.0.0`, all interfaces — unchanged from before `MCP_API_KEY` existed, so `docker compose`'s `-p 3100:3100` port publishing keeps working). Set to `127.0.0.1` for a genuinely local-only deployment; see `MCP_API_KEY` below. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | — | `info` or `debug` (default `info`) |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | — | Publicly reachable base URL of this server (e.g. `https://mcp.example.com`); used in manifest generation and as the OAuth redirect base; defaults to `http://localhost:<PORT>` |
| `MCP_API_KEY` | Required unless `HOST` is loopback | Shared secret required as `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_API_KEY>` on every `/mcp` request. **The server refuses to start without it on any non-loopback `HOST`** (fails closed — see [Identity & access control](#identity--access-control)); only `HOST=127.0.0.1`/`localhost`/`::1` may skip it, since nothing outside the machine can reach a loopback bind. |
| `TLS_CERT_PATH`, `TLS_KEY_PATH` | — | Paths to a PEM cert chain and matching private key. Set both to serve HTTPS directly instead of plain HTTP. |
| `TRUST_PROXY_TLS` | Alternative to `TLS_CERT_PATH`/`TLS_KEY_PATH` | Set to `true` when a trusted TLS-terminating reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik, Caddy, etc.) shares this process's network namespace. **This overrides `HOST` and forces the server to actually bind to loopback** rather than merely asserting a proxy exists — a configured `HOST` would otherwise remain a second, unprotected path straight to this plain-HTTP listener. Only a proxy in the same namespace (same container, Docker's `network_mode: service:<name>`, a Kubernetes sidecar, etc.) can then reach it; nothing routes to it from outside that boundary. Without this or `TLS_CERT_PATH`/`TLS_KEY_PATH`, the server refuses to start on a non-loopback `HOST`. |
| `METRICS_PUSH_URL` | — | Prometheus push gateway URL (optional) |
| `RESTRICTED_TOOLS` | — | Comma-separated tool names requiring FERPA auth (default: `get_at_risk_students,get_grade_distribution,get_submission_status,get_grades,list_users,get_user,list_enrollments,list_audit_logs`) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_STUDENT_PER_MINUTE` | — | Max tool calls per minute for student role (default `60`) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_INSTRUCTOR_PER_MINUTE` | — | Max tool calls per minute for instructor role (default `120`) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_ADMIN_PER_MINUTE` | — | Max tool calls per minute for admin role (default `180`) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_PARENT_PER_MINUTE` | — | Max tool calls per minute for parent role (default `60`) |

**Getting Blackboard credentials:**  
Register a REST API application at [developer.blackboard.com](https://developer.blackboard.com/portal/applications). Use the free developer sandbox for testing — no live Blackboard instance required.

### Authorization Code flow

bb-mcp now supports an operator-driven OAuth Authorization Code flow in addition to the existing client credentials probe path.

1. Visit `GET /oauth/authorize` to start the flow.
2. Blackboard redirects back to `GET /oauth/callback`.
3. bb-mcp validates the `state`, performs PKCE-backed token exchange, and returns a managed session payload.

For non-browser operators, `GET /oauth/authorize?format=json` returns the authorization URL and redirect URI without issuing an HTTP redirect.

---

## Tools

Every tool requires a `caller_identity` argument:

```json
{
  "caller_identity": {
    "userId": "bbuser123",
    "role": "student",
    "clientApp": "agent-board"
  }
}
```

For FERPA-restricted tools, add `"ferpa_authorized": true` — the calling application is responsible for asserting this only after real identity verification.

### Student tools

|---|---|
| `get_my_courses` | Courses the caller is enrolled in |
| `list_courses` | Alias for `get_my_courses` — compatibility name |
| `get_upcoming_assignments` | Assignments due within N days, sorted by due date |
| `get_my_grades` | Grade breakdown across all courses or one course |
| `get_course_content` | Course modules and materials, with optional keyword search |
| `get_course_contents` | Alias for `get_course_content` — compatibility name |
| `get_assignment_feedback` | Instructor comments, rubric scores, and annotations |
| `get_announcements` | Course announcements |
| `create_assignment_submission` | Submit an assignment attempt with optional student comments |

| `get_grade_distribution` | Mean, median, std dev, A/B/C/D/F buckets | ✅ |
| `get_discussion_summary` | Participant count and post excerpts for a thread | — |
| `get_at_risk_students` | Students with low grades or many missing submissions | ✅ |
| `draft_announcement` | AI-assisted announcement draft, optionally posted | — |

### Grade write-back tools

| Tool | Description | FERPA required |

## Identity & access control

**Transport gate (`MCP_API_KEY`)** — the `/mcp` endpoint itself has no other credential check, so without `MCP_API_KEY` configured, anyone who can reach the port can call any tool asserting any `caller_identity`. The server fails closed on whatever host it actually ends up listening on (`127.0.0.1`/`localhost`/`::1` is the only one that may skip it): it refuses to start without a key, **and** it refuses to start without `TLS_CERT_PATH`/`TLS_KEY_PATH` configured (serve HTTPS directly) — this server speaks plain HTTP on its own, and a bearer token sent that way can be captured and replayed by an on-path attacker. `TRUST_PROXY_TLS=true` is the other option, but it isn't a separate escape hatch from that requirement: it overrides `HOST` and forces an actual loopback bind, so the fail-closed check sees a loopback host either way — see [Configuration](#configuration).

Once past the transport gate, the auth layer enforces the following before any Blackboard API call is made:

1. **`caller_identity` is required** on every tool call — the client asserts who is asking. This identity is trusted at face value (bb-mcp does not itself verify end-user identity); `MCP_API_KEY` establishes that the *client* is one the operator issued a key to, not that the claimed `userId`/`role` is truthful — the calling application (e.g. agent-board) is responsible for that.
2. **Rate gate** — per-role, per-minute call limits prevent bulk data extraction; 429 responses include a retry-after interval
3. **Role gate** — instructor-only tools reject `role: "student"` callers
4. **FERPA gate** — tools that access protected student data require `ferpa_authorized: true`; this covers the instructor at-risk/grade/submission tools and the full admin directory surface (`list_users`, `get_user`, `list_enrollments`, `list_audit_logs`)
5. **Course entitlement gate** — the grade write-back tools (`create_assignment`, `create_grade_column`, `update_grade`, `delete_grade`, `exempt_grade`, `get_grade_column`) additionally verify the caller is enrolled in the target `courseId` as Instructor, TeachingAssistant, or CourseBuilder — role=instructor alone does not authorize writing grades in an arbitrary course. `role: "admin"` bypasses this course-scoped check (already trusted org-wide).

Every access attempt (granted or denied) is written to stdout as structured JSON, and kept in a bounded in-memory ring buffer — bb-mcp's own **local audit trail**. User identifiers in this local trail are SHA-256 hashed before emission or storage; raw user IDs are never written to bb-mcp's own logs or returned in the `localAuditTrail` portion of `list_audit_logs`'s response. This hashing does *not* apply to the separate `logs` field in that same response, which passes through the Blackboard instance's own `/audit/logs` entries (when available) unmodified, including whatever raw user identifiers Blackboard itself records — the same identifiers an admin caller can already resolve directly via `get_user`/`list_users` under the same role+FERPA gate, so this is consistent with, not a bypass of, that authorization boundary.

On top of the audit-log scrubbing above, every tool response is separately scrubbed before it reaches the MCP client — `src/output-scrub.ts` strips email addresses (by field name and by pattern) out of the actual `get_my_grades` / `list_roster` / `list_users` / etc. payloads, applied centrally via `withMetrics()` so no individual tool can skip it.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-24T10:00:00.000Z",
  "event": "access.granted",
  "tool": "get_my_grades",
  "subject": "anon:a3f9c1e02b47",
  "role": "student",
  "courseId": null,
  "clientApp": "agent-board",
  "reason": null,
  "piiRedaction": "hashed-subject"
}
```

This format is suitable for ingestion by any log aggregator (Datadog, CloudWatch, Loki, etc.).

---

## Metrics

`GET /metrics` returns Prometheus-compatible text:

```
bb_mcp_tool_calls_total{tool="get_my_courses"} 42
bb_mcp_tool_errors_total{tool="get_my_grades"} 1
bb_mcp_tool_avg_duration_ms{tool="get_upcoming_assignments"} 238
```

Set `METRICS_PUSH_URL` to push to a Prometheus push gateway every 60 seconds.

---

## agent-board integration

The server runs as a service in agent-board's Docker stack. The connector config lives at `agent-board/config/connectors.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Blackboard Learn",
  "mcp_server": "http://bb-mcp:3100",
  "system_prompt": "You are a helpful study assistant...",
  "safety_config": "strict",
  "guided_prompts": [
    "What do I have due this week?",
    "How am I doing in my courses?",
    "Summarize what I missed"
  ]
}
```

agent-board proxies MCP calls through `POST /api/mcp/blackboard-learn/proxy`, keeping credentials server-side.
