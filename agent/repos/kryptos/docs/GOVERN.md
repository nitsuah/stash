## Monthly Governance Review (May 2026 — Q4 Completion)

_Completed: 2026-05-30_

- All Q4 2026 deliverables shipped: S→T→S composite chain, ADFGVX, Nihilist, fuzzy dedup heuristics, keyspace-stats CLI, K1/K2/K3 reliability gates.
- 811 tests passing, 0 failures. No deprecated or TODO markers remain in source.
- ROADMAP.md updated: Q4 marked Completed ✅. Next review scheduled 2026-06-30.
- ADFGVX and Nihilist exposed in `kryptos.k4` public API; pipeline can now discover them by name.
- Eureka early-stop wired into S→T→S chain — consistent with composite_sweep.py halt protocol.
- K1/K2/K3 Sanborn misspellings (IQLUSION, DESPARATLY, UNDERGRUUND) now enforced by deterministic gate tests.


## Monthly Governance Review (August 2026)

_Completed: 2026-08-12_

- All five previously-open K4 attack vectors (clock→Hill, 4-char clock→Vigenère, sub-row encodings, lamp-count transposition, Beaufort sweep) confirmed complete with null results. Added to `K4_ACTIVE_RESEARCH.md` completed table.
- `K4_KEYSTREAM_ANALYSIS.md` sections 7.5–7.7 updated from "NOT YET RUN" to confirmed null results; Open Questions section updated — 11 total items (6 resolved, 5 open).
- `K4_ATTACK_LANDSCAPE.md` created — 3D fingerprint covering all past, present, and frontier attack directions.
- `TASKS.md` and `ROADMAP.md` updated with 3-layer composite attacks as next strategic priority.
- Test count updated in `METRICS.md` (829 tests, up from 633 at last metrics update).
- `docs/INDEX.md` updated with new landscape document.
- Deprecated code: `executor.py` remains marked legacy (retiring after migration confirmation); all other deprecated markers clean. No open CI failures, no governance intervention required.
- Next review: September 2026 (add/update this section monthly).

- Quagmire I–IV solver and sweep (6,240 combinations) complete; null result. Physical-grid tableau walk complete; null result.
- SA columnar seeding and early-crib locking verified end-to-end with >90% pruning efficiency.
- Benchmark runner and CI job added for throughput tracking.
- No open issues or PRs requiring governance intervention.
- Next review: August 2026 (add/update this section monthly).

## Monthly Governance Review (May 2026)

- All K4-ATTACK, infrastructure, and CLI objectives for Phase 6.3 are complete and validated.
- Legacy executor/wrapper surfaces have been reviewed; no remaining executor.py or wrapper modules in the codebase.
- Autonomous campaign orchestration and robust NLP fallback are now the default, with all dependencies optional.
- Documentation, test, and artifact hygiene are enforced via pre-commit and CI.
- No open issues or PRs requiring governance intervention at this time.
- Next review: June 2026 (add/update this section monthly).

## Governance Policy

- All major architectural or research changes require evidence-backed validation and must be documented in ROADMAP.md and TASKS.md.
- Monthly review notes are to be added/updated in this file and referenced in ROADMAP.md.
- Deprecated or legacy code must be retired promptly after migration is confirmed.
- Community contributions are reviewed according to CONTRIBUTING.md and must meet reproducibility and documentation standards.

For historical governance notes, see docs/archive/ and AUDIT files.
In the future this process should fully expand to include more audit coverage of features and functional changes as well as cleanup and refactoring guidance.
Update this doc accordingly to keep improving this repo via ROADMAP and TASKS.
