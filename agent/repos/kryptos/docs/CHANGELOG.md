## [Unreleased]

### Added (2026-09-28 — frontier pass)

- `kryptos.k4.frontier_checks` (P22, `kryptos frontier`, API `p22_frontier_checks`): recurrence keys, periodic key + arbitrary mixed alphabet, dial keys, routes along every compass bearing, Hill 4×4 (exhaustive) and 5×5 (11.9M matrices scored), running keys from any English text (direct and after columnar transposition), and `reconstruction_suite`, which tests the published full-plaintext reconstruction against every family. Each check has a positive control.
- `frontier_checks.wide_columnar_scan` (exact search over column orders past brute force; widths 10–14 null), `hill_beam_search` (Hill 5×5 at the alignments exhaustive search can't reach), `vocabulary_phrase_keys`.
- `kryptos.k4.english_model` with English 3- and 4-gram tables built from 8.9M letters of public-domain text (`scripts/data/build_english_ngrams.py`).
- Ledger: 6 new eliminated entries, 3 new statistical entries; the open entries narrowed to what is actually left.

### Found (2026-09-28)

- The n-gram tables the main scorer read (`data/ngrams/{bi,tri,quad}grams.tsv`) were placeholders of about ten entries each. Fixed: `scoring` now loads `english_{2,3,4}grams.tsv`; English vs shuffled-English separation on 97 letters rises from d = 4.2 to 9.4 with no overlap. Rankings from earlier sweeps used the old tables.

### Added (2026-09-28 — second negative-space pass)

- `crib_constraints`: error tolerance (`_min_violations`, `tolerance=` on the columnar/geometry scans) and `tolerance_study()` against shuffled-ciphertext controls; `double_periodic_consistency()` (any two periodic keys, solved over GF(2)/GF(13)); `quagmire4_scan()`; `monoalphabetic_conflicts()`; structural checks in the suite output.
- `kryptos.k4.structural_checks`: output-alphabet eliminations, nulls between the crib blocks, Hill 2×2/3×3, K3-style double rotation, columnar + autokey, columnar + running key, Chaocipher (validated against Byrne's published example).
- Job persistence: `k4_attack_jobs` table, finished jobs saved when `DATABASE_URL` is set, `GET /api/k4/attacks/jobs`.
- `hypothesis_ledger.latest_run()` in `GET /api/k4/ledger`; new ledger entries and tiers.
- `docs/sources/SANBORN_QUOTES.md`: Sanborn's statements with citations.
- `quagmire4_dictionary_scan()`: exact dictionary × dictionary Quagmire IV via a difference-vector index (about 5.4×10¹⁰ pairs in 13 s).
- `kryptos.k4.run_store` + `k4_constraint_runs` table: suite runs stored in Neon; `latest_run` falls back to it.
- `kryptos ledger [--json]`: prints the hypothesis ledger from code.
- P21 is single-flight: a second `POST /api/k4/attacks/run` for `p21_crib_constraints` while one is queued or running returns 409 with the active job id. The suite artifact is written to a temp file and renamed into place.
- Rules in `docs/GOVERN.md`, enforced by tests: every `eliminated` ledger entry needs a positive control; the attack registry must match the dispatcher.

### Fixed (2026-09-28 — second pass)

- `scoring.WORDLIST` was an 18-word fallback because `data/wordlist.txt` never existed; it now loads a 261k-word dictionary (4+ letters). English/random separation 1.55 → 1.91.
- `key_csp.periodic_family_consistency` had no positive control (caught by the new rule); it now takes `ciphertext`/`cribs` and has one.
- Docs overstated the word list's reach ("every sweep leaned on it"); the main scorer uses n-grams.

### Added (2026-09-28 — negative-space pass)

- **P21 crib-constraint engine** (`kryptos.k4.crib_constraints`): tests whole cipher families against the 24 crib key values instead of sampling keys. Every check has a positive-control test. Eliminated over stated ranges: ciphertext/plaintext autokey, linear, progressive and Gronsfeld digit keys; running keys over a sculpture corpus (best 7–8/24, equal to a shuffled control); Quagmire I–III for 231,933 dictionary keyword alphabets (periods ≤ 25); columnar transpositions of width 2–9 and 7,680 geometric mappings composed with a periodic key (periods ≤ 22, both layer orders).
- `kryptos crib-constraints` CLI command and `p21_crib_constraints` API attack.
- `kryptos.k4.hypothesis_ledger` and `GET /api/k4/ledger[?tier=]`: every hypothesis family tagged `eliminated` / `statistical` / `sampled_null` / `open`.
- `docs/analysis/K4_NEGATIVE_SPACE.md`: ranked list of untried or under-tested directions.
- `english-words` (MIT) dependency for the dictionary keyword scan.

### Fixed (2026-09-28)

- `running_key.K3_PLAINTEXT_FULL` contained invented text after character 97; now the real K3 plaintext. P6 used only the first 97 characters, so its result stands.
- `cli/main.py`: removed 136 lines of unreachable duplicate parser code after `return parser`.
- P18 frontier description said 22 crib pairs; there are 24.
- Elonka Dunin and FOIA outreach drafts moved into `docs/TASKS.md` from a retired briefing page.

### Fixed (2026-09-27 — K4 deep-dive audit)

- **K4 IC figures in the docs were wrong.** The overall IC is 0.0361, not ≈0.062. Segment ICs are 0.046/0.046/0.034, not 0.058/0.071/0.062. The "substitution → transposition confirmed" architecture built on them is downgraded to a working hypothesis in `K4_ACTIVE_RESEARCH.md`, `K4_KEYSTREAM_ANALYSIS.md`, ROADMAP and README.
- EAST crib release date: Aug 2020, not 2023.
- "THE COMPASS ROSE IS HERE" was credited to Sanborn's own recovered plaintext in ROADMAP, TASKS and `K4_ACTIVE_RESEARCH.md`. It is solvekryptos.com's reconstruction.
- ROADMAP attributed the 17/20 crib shifts to EAST/NORTHEAST; they come from BERLIN/CLOCK.
- `docs/sources/CLOCK.md`: 148 → 146 city names plus a date-line plate; unsourced claims flagged.
- `key_csp.CRIB_SHIFTS` is derived from `keystream_validator.K4_CRIBS` instead of hand-typed; docstrings said 22 shifts, there are 24.
- Lint: unused imports, duplicate set items in `bigram_constraint.COMMON_ENGLISH_DOUBLETS`.

### Added (2026-09-27)

- `kryptos.k4.ic_profile`: overall/segment IC and a reshuffle significance test for segment spread.
- `key_csp.periodic_family_consistency()`: periods 1–26 are inconsistent with the cribs under Vigenère, Beaufort, Variant Beaufort and KRYPTOS-keyed Quagmire III.
- `keystream_validator.K4_CRIB_RELEASES`: crib ciphertext, release month, venue.
- `tests/functional/test_k4_documented_facts.py`: pins every number above.

### Added (2026-08-29 → 2026-09-03 — K4 Phases 6–8, all null)

- **Phase 6 — Physical/Geometric Pivot** (#192, #193, #194, #196): 24-column geometric permutation front-end, precise WGS84 geodesy (`kryptos.k4.geodesy`), Mengenlehreuhr→Weltzeituhr bearing, Nov 9 1989 clock state, Myszkowski/Trifid, SA substitution search; first real executions of P2/P5/P6; dashboard Pivot Status panel.
- **Phase 7** — shape-changing transpose family, `solar_geometry` (shadow hypothesis), `world_clock_cities` (130/146 names sourced), `cross_vector_consensus`, `overnight_runner`: 2,420,928 candidates, null.
- **Phase 8 follow-ups** — `plaintext_evidence`, `known_plaintext_inversion` (incl. 3,674,160 rectangular-grid permutations), mirrored tableau, `k0_morse_keywords`, `classical_cipher_sweep`, `physical_geometry`, `constraint_chain`: all null.

### Fixed (2026-09)

- `keystream_validator.K4_CRIBS` stored `EAST`/`NORTHEAST` one position too high (22/26 → 21/25); same bug fixed in `key_csp.py` and `clock_hill_attack.py` (found via PR #203 review).
- Broken Docker fast-coverage command in docs (#215).

### Changed (2026-09)

- `k4_attack_routes.py` split into a thin route module plus `k4_jobs.py` (job status store) and `k4_attack_dispatch.py` (attack dispatch table) — no behavior change; covered by new characterization tests in `test_k4_attack_routes.py`.
- Netlify + Render deployment documented; Netlify deploy badge in README (#219, #220); orphaned `.playwright-mcp` artifacts untracked (#221).
- Dependency floors raised: openai ≥3.15, anthropic ≥1.6, uvicorn ≥0.53, transformers ≥5.17, psycopg2-binary (#212–#218).
- Planning docs reset for 2027 (`pmo-ff`): completed ROADMAP phases (1–4, 6, 7) and TASKS Done moved verbatim to `docs/archive/2026-completed-roadmap-and-tasks.md` and summarized in FEATURES; Phase 8 carried into 2027 Q1; plain-text `Breadcrumb:` lines replaced with linked breadcrumb navigation; README docs index added.

### Added

- `docs/analysis/K4_ATTACK_LANDSCAPE.md` — 3D attack fingerprint document: past (all systematically-tested single-layer and 2-layer vectors with evidence), present (working hypotheses, InstructionalScorer, Eureka protocol), and frontier (10 untested directions — P1–P7 active, P8–P10 deferred — with implementation checklists)
- `kryptos serve` command and minimal FastAPI app (`src/kryptos/api/`) exposing `/health`, `/api/rag/status`,
  `POST /api/rag/reindex`, and `GET /api/rag/search` endpoints
- turbovec-backed `ArtifactIndex` (`src/kryptos/rag/`) for semantic search over `artifacts/`, using
  `sentence-transformers` embeddings and a 4-bit quantized `turbovec.IdMapIndex` persisted under `data/turbovec/`

### Changed (2026-08-12 doc refresh)

- `docs/analysis/K4_KEYSTREAM_ANALYSIS.md` — Sections 7.5–7.7 updated from "NOT YET RUN" to confirmed null results; Open Questions section expanded from 7 to 11 items reflecting current frontier
- `docs/analysis/K4_ACTIVE_RESEARCH.md` — Active attack queue rebuilt: completed-attacks table (14 null-result attack sweeps), frontier queue (7 active + 3 deferred vectors), infrastructure status corrected from "Implemented" to "Complete/null result" for all 5 PR-83 attacks
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — Replaced "Untested K4 Attack Vectors" section with completed-vectors table and new "Frontier K4 Attack Vectors" section (10 total: P1–P7 active, P8–P10 deferred)
- `docs/TASKS.md` — Added Phase 0 (Frontier K4 Attack Planning) with 7 active + 3 deferred implementation tasks (10 total); added CONTRIBUTING.md position-label fix to Phase 3
- `docs/analysis/30_YEAR_GAP_COVERAGE.md` — Beaufort status corrected from ❌ Missing to ✅ Swept (null); Gronsfeld gap impact upgraded to MEDIUM; 3-layer composite gap upgraded to HIGH priority
- `docs/METRICS.md` — Test count corrected from 633 to 829 (AUDIT_2026-06-01 baseline); K4 readiness updated from 7.5/10 to 8.5/10
- `docs/GOVERN.md` — Added July and August 2026 governance review entries
- `docs/INDEX.md` — K4_ATTACK_LANDSCAPE.md added; AUDIT_2026-06-01 added; analysis section reordered most-important-first
