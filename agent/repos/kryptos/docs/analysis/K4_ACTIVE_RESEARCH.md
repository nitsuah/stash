## Ruled Out (Confirmed Negative Results)

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Single-layer repeating Vigenère with any key | RULED OUT | HRDXDBAUZGSAV as repeating key does not produce English outside crib window |
| Direct Berlin Clock single-layer Vigenère | RULED OUT | All 720 clock states tested (`run_composite_sweep`). Shifts include 17, 20, 25 which no clock row can produce alone. |
| Transposition-first composite | RULED OUT | Non-uniform local IC is a signature of substitution-then-transposition order |
| Simple Caesar or monoalphabetic substitution | RULED OUT | IC ≈ 0.062 rules out single-alphabet substitution |
| K1/K2 keys (PALIMPSEST, ABSCISSA) as direct Vigenère keys for K4 | RULED OUT | Confirmed by community + pipeline results |
| Keyed alphabet (KRYPTOS/PALIMPSEST/ABSCISSA) realignment → structured keystream | RULED OUT | `check_keyed_alphabet_realignment` tested all three alphabets; keystream at EAST+NORTHEAST positions does not resolve to a recognizable pattern under any of them |
| Full composite sweep: 3 alphabets × 3 grid sizes × 720 clock states × ENE+columnar routes | NULL RESULT | `run_composite_sweep` completed; no simultaneous 4-crib match. Null artifact: `K4_COMPOSITE_SWEEP_NULL.json`. Best candidates had ≤1 keyword hit. |
| ENE diagonal route transposition (67.5°) with clock-Vigenère | NULL RESULT | `read_ene_diagonal` integrated into full sweep; all route variants tested. No breakthrough. |
| ADFGVX (Polybius + columnar transposition) | NULL RESULT | Implemented (`kryptos.k4.adfgvx`) and tested against K4; no crib match |
| Nihilist (Polybius + numeric key) | NULL RESULT | Implemented (`kryptos.k4.nihilist`) and tested against K4; no crib match |
| Pure (single-layer) Quagmire I–IV | NULL RESULT | `run_quagmire_sweep` — 6,240 combinations: Q1/Q2/Q3 × 4 alphabet keywords × 10 word keys × 2 indicator bases, Q4 ordered keyword pairs, plus Q3 × 1,440 Berlin Clock minute-state indicator keys on the KRYPTOS tableau. Zero positional crib or keyword hits. Artifact: `K4_QUAGMIRE_NULL.json`. Reinforces the substitution+transposition composite model — implementation verified by exactly reproducing K1/K2 (Quagmire III, KRYPTOS tableau). |
| Physical-grid (copper-screen tableau) keystreams | NULL RESULT | `run_physical_grid_attack` — walks the 26×26 KRYPTOS Vigenère tableau along 108 geometric routes (26 rows, 26 columns, 26 main/26 anti diagonals, 4 serpentine reads) × 2 indicator bases = 216 candidates via Quagmire III. Zero positional crib hits. Artifact: `K4_PHYSICAL_GRID_NULL.json`. Tests the "physical keystream read off the sculpture" theory. (Note: on the cyclic tableau the diagonals are degenerate — anti-diagonals are constant letters, main diagonals 13-letter cycles — so rows/columns/serpentine are the substantive routes.) |

## Current Structural Understanding

**Cipher architecture (most likely):**
```
plaintext
    ↓
[Layer A: substitution — likely polyalphabetic or matrix-based]
    ↓
pre-transposition text
    ↓
[Layer B: transposition — geometric/columnar/route]
    ↓
K4 ciphertext (97 chars)
```

**Decryption direction (attack):**
```
K4 ciphertext
    ↓
[Invert Layer B: transposition reversal]
    ↓
substituted-but-not-transposed text
    ↓
[Invert Layer A: substitution reversal with key]
    ↓
plaintext
```

**Key insight:** The 13 characters at K4 positions 22–34 (LRVQQPRNGKSSO) that produce EASTNORTHEAST under some key were NOT contiguous in the pre-transposition text. The transposition pulled them from scattered positions. Reversing the transposition first is the prerequisite for clean substitution key recovery.

### Derived Keystreams (Vigenère-equivalent per-position shifts)

Assuming pure Vigenère at the substitution layer (before transposition):

```
EAST (pos 22–25):      keystream = HRDX  (shifts: 7, 17, 3, 23)
NORTHEAST (pos 26–34): keystream = DBAUZGSAV  (shifts: 3, 1, 0, 20, 25, 6, 18, 0, 21)
BERLIN (pos 63–68):    keystream = MUYKLG  (shifts: 12, 20, 24, 10, 11, 6)
CLOCK (pos 69–73):     keystream = KORNA  (shifts: 10, 14, 17, 13, 0)
```

Under the composite model, these are NOT the actual substitution key letters at those positions — they are the effective shifts after the transposition has already rearranged things. The true key letters live at the transposition source positions, not the ciphertext positions.

## Active Attack Queue (Priority Order)

### ✅ DONE — Priority 1: Inverse Transposition + Keystream Collapse
`kryptos.k4.inverse_transposition_sweep.full_sweep` — all 3 grid geometries, ENE diagonal + columnar routes. **Null result.** No transposition permutation produced a recognizable keystream at EAST+NORTHEAST positions.

### ✅ DONE — Priority 2: Keyed Alphabet Realignment
`check_keyed_alphabet_realignment` — KRYPTOS, PALIMPSEST, ABSCISSA alphabets tested. **Null result.** No keyed alphabet remapping produces a structured keystream.

### ✅ DONE — Priority 3: Full Composite Sweep (Clock × Grid × Alphabet)
`run_composite_sweep` — 3 alphabets × 3 grids × 720 clock states × ENE+columnar routes. **Null result.** Artifact: `K4_COMPOSITE_SWEEP_NULL.json`. No simultaneous 4-crib match found.

### ✅ DONE — Priority 4: InstructionalScorer
`kryptos.k4.scoring_instructional` — vocabulary boost, Levenshtein fuzzy match, entropy gate. Integrated into sweep scoring pipeline.

### ✅ DONE — Priority 5: BERLIN+CLOCK Positional Refinement
Confirmed via `validate_k4_cribs` and `keystream_summary`. Positions 63–68 (BERLIN) and 69–73 (CLOCK) validated. Keystreams MUYKLG and KORNA computed and stored in `k4_keystream` DB table.

### Priority 1 (NEW): Clock → Hill 2×2 Invertibility Pre-filter

**Goal:** Use the Berlin Clock as a Hill 2×2 matrix key directly, not as a Vigenère shift sequence.

**The specific attack not yet run:**
1. For each of the 720 clock states, form a 2×2 matrix from the first 4 lamp values
2. Filter: only ~15% of clock states yield invertible matrices mod 26 (~100 candidates)
3. For each invertible state, apply Hill 2×2 decryption to K4 using that matrix
4. Validate EAST+NORTHEAST cribs in the result
5. If any match, try all column-width permutations on the result

This is distinct from what we've run: we've tested Hill keys exhaustively and clock-Vigenère exhaustively, but **never clock-as-Hill-matrix specifically**.

**Estimated search space:** ~100 clock states × Hill decryption. Trivial runtime.

### Priority 2 (NEW): 4-char Clock Key → Vigenère with NORTHEAST Anchor

**Goal:** Derive a 4-character Vigenère key from each clock state (not the full 4–8 char shift sequence) and test it with the NORTHEAST crib as a positional anchor.

**The gap:** Current sweep cycles through full `berlin_clock_shifts` output (variable length). This attack specifically maps each clock state to a 4-char key (e.g., hour-row sum, minute-row sum, etc. encoded as letters) and tests those as Vigenère keys with `positional_crib_bonus` gating on NORTHEAST at position 26.

**Estimated search space:** 720 states × a few encoding schemes. Sub-second.

### Priority 3 (NEW): Non-standard Berlin Clock encodings

**Goal:** The current sweep uses `full_berlin_clock_shifts` (all 4 lamp rows concatenated). Sanborn may have used a subset or different encoding:
- 5-hour row only (single digit 0–4)
- Top two rows only (5-hour + 1-hour = effective hour 0–23 as 2 values)
- Minute rows only (5-min + 1-min)
- Clock-position-to-alphabet mapping (row values → keyed alphabet offset)

None of these sub-encodings have been tested in isolation.

### Priority 4 (NEW): Berlin Clock × Transposition Column Widths

**Goal:** Use lamp counts from the Berlin Clock as columnar transposition widths, not as Vigenère shifts. At 23:59 the lamp rows show [4,3,11,4] — use these as column widths for a 4-round columnar transposition.

This was mentioned in `K4-T1.md` and `30_YEAR_GAP_COVERAGE.md` but the composite sweep used clock values as Vigenère shifts only, not as transposition column widths.

### Priority 5 (OPEN): Beaufort cipher sweep

`kryptos.k4.beaufort` is implemented but **no systematic sweep against K4 has been run**. Beaufort is the "reciprocal Vigenère" — encryption and decryption use the same operation. Worth a quick pass with the same key candidates used for Vigenère (KRYPTOS, PALIMPSEST, BERLIN, CLOCK, etc.).

| SA columnar transposition (seedable) | ✅ Verified | `solve_columnar_permutation_simulated_annealing(..., seed_perm=...)` — gains an optional starting permutation so the search can be seeded from a known pattern (e.g. K3's width/rotation). Verified end-to-end (`tests/e2e/test_sa_transposition_crib_lock.py`): recovers a planted columnar plaintext on realistic-length text; seeding at the optimum never scores worse than the seed. |
| Early-crib locking (search pruning) | ✅ Verified | `search_with_multiple_cribs_positions` rejects permutations that don't place the cribs at their known positions *before* scoring. Verified to prune >90% of the columnar permutation space at depth 1 (5040→2 for one crib, →1 for two) while always retaining the true permutation, and the top crib-consistent candidate is the real plaintext. Sidesteps the n-gram scoring misranking that affects short fragments. |
