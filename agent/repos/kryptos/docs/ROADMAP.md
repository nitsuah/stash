> 2027 planning reset (2026-09-24): completed Phases 1–4, 6 and 7 (all null — every code-executable direction
> identified so far) and Phase 8's two closed leads were moved verbatim to
> [archive/2026-completed-roadmap-and-tasks.md](./archive/2026-completed-roadmap-and-tasks.md) and summarized in
> [FEATURES](./FEATURES.md). What remains open is carried into 2027 Q1 below.

## Current Status

**K4 attack phase:** Phases 6 and 7 (Physical/Geometric Pivot, then the shape-changing transpose family + shadow-angle primitives + city-list keywords + cross-vector consensus scoring) are both complete — every code-executable direction identified so far, including the shape-changing transpose family and both readings of the "shadow of the word" hypothesis, has been implemented, executed against real K4, and returned null. Phase 8 (active) opened three primary-source gaps; two closed 2026-09-02 and one (the compass-rose bearing) remains — see below.

**Architecture (corrected 2026-09-27):** What is established is that a flattening, polyalphabetic-like layer exists (K4's IC is 0.0361, near random), and that no direct periodic key of length ≤ 26 fits the cribs under Vigenère, Beaufort, Variant Beaufort, or KRYPTOS-keyed Quagmire III. This line used to say "Confirmed substitution → transposition". That rested on IC figures (≈0.062, and a 0.058/0.071/0.062 segment table) that don't match the ciphertext, so neither the transposition layer nor the layer order is established (see `docs/analysis/K4_KEYSTREAM_ANALYSIS.md` §4–5). The key is not derivable from any standard Mengenlehreuhr row value: crib shifts reach 17, 20, 24, 25, above the maximum row output of 11. Per Sanborn's Nov 2025 clarification, BERLIN CLOCK refers to the Weltzeituhr in any case. The transposition is not a standard rectangular grid in any simple reading order, including both the shape-preserving and shape-changing 24-column geometric families. At minimum one un-parameterized step remains — the most concrete remaining candidate is a genuinely physical fact this repo cannot fully source on its own: the Kryptos compass rose's exact bearing, still unmeasured by anyone as far as any source checked shows. (The World Clock city list, the other primary-source gap this line used to cite, closed 2026-09-02 at 130 of 146 names — see Phase 8.) A precisely-timed historical moment was found 2026-09-02 (see Phase 8).

## 2027 Q1 — Phase 8: Primary-Source Sourcing (Active — opened 2026-09-01)

Two workstreams remain. The compass-rose bearing needs new source material. Code-side constraint and scoring work also remains, listed further down. Of the three source gaps opened 2026-09-01, two closed 2026-09-02 (World Clock city list at 130/146; sub-minute Nov 9 1989 timestamp). One remains:

- [ ] **The Kryptos compass rose's actual measured bearing.** Confirmed via `elonka.com`'s own wishlist to be a still-open *community-wide* question, not just a gap in this repo. One uncertain secondary estimate exists (~220°, explicitly flagged inexact). 2026-09-02: satellite imagery of the CIA courtyard was inspected directly (Google Maps, unblurred) and ruled out — resolution is building/lot-scale, not fine enough for a ground-level stone engraving. Remaining leads: a CIA FOIA/public-affairs request, or contacting Elonka Dunin directly. Outreach drafts for both (the questions to ask Elonka, and the FOIA request text) are ready — see `docs/TASKS.md`.
- [ ] **Send the three outreach drafts** — FOIA request (foia.cia.gov, asking for the 1990 landscape/installation drawing), Elonka Dunin, and CIA Public Affairs (authorized research visit). All three are drafted in `docs/TASKS.md` (FOIA and Elonka under the compass-rose item, Public Affairs as its own item); each needs a human send.

Inventing more sweep variants over the same structural assumptions (grids, reflections, rotations, clock states) is not expected to help (see Phase 7's zero cross-vector consensus result). The productive code-side direction is testing whole families against the 24 crib key values instead of sampling keys.

- [x] **Crib-constraint engine (P21, 2026-09-28).** `kryptos.k4.crib_constraints` eliminates, over stated ranges: autokey (both kinds), linear, progressive and digit keys; running keys over the sculpture corpus; dictionary keyword alphabets for Quagmire I–III (231,933 alphabets, periods ≤ 25); and columnar (widths 2–9) or geometric transpositions composed with a periodic key of period ≤ 22, in either layer order. Runnable via `kryptos crib-constraints` or the `p21_crib_constraints` API attack. Machine-readable status: `GET /api/k4/ledger`.
- [x] **Next constraint checks (2026-09-28).** Double-periodic keys (any keys, p1 + p2 ≤ 24), Quagmire IV (vocabulary × dictionary), K3-style double rotation, columnar + autokey/running key, nulls between cribs, Hill 2×2/3×3, 25-letter output ciphers, error-tolerant scans against controls, Chaocipher (sampled). All null. See [`docs/analysis/K4_NEGATIVE_SPACE.md`](./analysis/K4_NEGATIVE_SPACE.md).
- [x] **Frontier checks (P22, 2026-09-28)** — recurrence, mixed-alphabet, dial and bearing-route keys, Hill 4×4 eliminated; Hill 5×5 and English running keys statistical; columnar widths 10–14 by exact search; the full-plaintext reconstruction fits no tested family.
- [ ] **Remaining open families** — long-key rules not yet named, Hill 6×6+, masking that inserts or drops letters, per-letter lookup keys (Weltzeituhr). Ranked in the same doc.
- [x] **Real scoring word list (2026-09-28)** — 261k-word dictionary, calibrated (see TASKS).

**External developments (2025–2026):** Sanborn's 1990 archival papers were found by independent researchers (Sept 2025, not a cryptographic solve); a Sanborn-confirmed K5 exists; a third-party reconstruction (solvekryptos.com) aligns with all four confirmed crib anchors after this repo's own `K4_CRIBS` off-by-one bug was fixed. Its mechanism is not published in enough detail to reproduce. Its opening line, "THE COMPASS ROSE IS HERE," is part of that reconstruction. It is not Sanborn's recovered text, which Kobek and Byrne have not released, and it is not independent evidence (earlier versions of this doc said it was; corrected 2026-09-27). Paradigm self-identified as the buyer in June 2026 and runs a $1-per-guess K4 verifier alongside its Kryptos CTF. Follow-up rounds 1–3 (2026-09-03) were all null. Full detail: `docs/analysis/K4_ACTIVE_RESEARCH.md`'s "External Developments" sections.
