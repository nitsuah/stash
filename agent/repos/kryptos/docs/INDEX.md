## Analysis

- [docs/analysis/K4_ACTIVE_RESEARCH.md](analysis/K4_ACTIVE_RESEARCH.md) - **The single current source of truth for K4 status: confirmed facts, ruled-out hypotheses, Phase 1-7 results, and open primary-source needs**

## Planning

- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) - High-level project roadmap
- [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) - Current task backlog

## Historical / Archived

- [docs/archive/AUDIT_2026-06-01.md](archive/AUDIT_2026-06-01.md) - Most recent src/ audit (see doc for test counts)
- [docs/archive/AUDIT_2026-05-24.md](archive/AUDIT_2026-05-24.md)
- [docs/archive/AUDIT_2025-10-26.md](archive/AUDIT_2025-10-26.md)
- [docs/archive/K4_ATTACK_LANDSCAPE.md](archive/K4_ATTACK_LANDSCAPE.md) - Superseded 2026-09-01 by K4_ACTIVE_RESEARCH.md; kept for historical evidence-basis narrative
- [docs/archive/K4-T1.md](archive/K4-T1.md) - Superseded 2026-09-01. Its "2025 Smithsonian Archive"/"K5" premise was flagged unverified/likely-fabricated as of that date — **that flag was wrong**; both are real (see K4_ACTIVE_RESEARCH.md's External Developments section). Its specific mechanism (RIS, ENE routing, Hill 2×2) is still null as originally noted
- [docs/archive/K4-CLOCKS.html](archive/K4-CLOCKS.html) - Superseded 2026-09-01; NORTHEAST position labels are known incorrect (see K4_KEYSTREAM_ANALYSIS.md §1)
- [docs/archive/K4-FRONTEND.md](archive/K4-FRONTEND.md) - Superseded 2026-09-01; describes a SQLite schema that was never built (actual: Neon/Postgres)

## Sources

- [docs/sources/SANBORN.md](sources/SANBORN.md) - Sanborn research checklist and artist-clue strategy
- [docs/sources/CLOCK.md](sources/CLOCK.md) - World Clock / Berlin Clock geographic and cryptographic interpretation

> **DB-backed sources** (query via `source_chunks`, `sanborn_timeline`, `discovered_cribs` tables):
> Smithsonian 2009 oral history transcript, Sanborn public statement timeline, crib candidates with provenance.

## Reading Order

2. This index for navigation.
3. CONTRIBUTING for operating standards and autonomous quickstart.
4. ROADMAP and TASKS for active priorities and execution queue.
5. Reference docs for implementation details.
6. Analysis docs for measured validation and pattern evidence.
