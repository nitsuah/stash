# PM Agent Instructions: Updating Repository Documentation for Overseer Compliance

**Purpose**: This document provides comprehensive instructions for AI agents tasked with updating repository documentation to meet Overseer's parsing and display requirements.

**Context**: Overseer is a meta-repository intelligence dashboard that parses standardized markdown files (ROADMAP.md, TASKS.md, METRICS.md, FEATURES.md, etc.) to provide health scoring, project tracking, and documentation compliance monitoring across multiple repositories.

---

## Introduction

I need you to update this repository's documentation to meet Overseer compliance standards.

**Instructions:**

1. Read the PM.md guidelines below carefully
2. Read this entire repository to understand what it does
3. Update ROADMAP.md, TASKS.md, FEATURES.md, METRICS.md, CHANGELOG.md, and other required docs
4. Preserve all existing content - only fix formatting and add missing sections
5. Create a feature branch called `docs/overseer-compliance` (NOT main)
6. Never hallucinate features or metrics - use "TBD" if unsure
7. Be sure metrics are accurate, double check numbers, run tests yourself, ensure conformity (can always include additional attribute value pairs but keep existing ones unless no longer relevant)

**Critical:** This is about conforming to format standards while keeping all repository-specific content intact.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Read Repository Context First

**Before making ANY changes:**

1. **Read the entire repository** - Understand what the project does, its tech stack, and its current state
2. **Read existing documentation** - Do NOT blindly overwrite existing content with templates
3. **Preserve custom content** - The goal is to conform to format expectations while keeping the repository's unique information
4. **Only update on non-main branches** - Never push directly to main/master unless explicitly authorized
5. **DO NOT commit automatically** - Stage changes and let the user review before committing

**Golden Rule**: You are ENHANCING and CONFORMING existing docs, not replacing them wholesale.

**Workflow Rule**: STAGE changes, but let the user COMMIT and PUSH after review.

## 📋 Required Documentation Files

Overseer expects these files at the repository root:

### Core Tracked Documents (Parsed & Displayed)

1. **README.md** - Project overview and setup instructions
2. **ROADMAP.md** - High-level objectives and quarterly plans
3. **TASKS.md** - Granular task tracking by status
4. **METRICS.md** - Custom repository metrics
5. **FEATURES.md** - Features organized by category

### Standard Documents (Presence Tracked)

- **LICENSE.md** - Project license
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contribution guidelines

### Community Standards (Tracked for Health Score)

- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Community behavior guidelines
- **SECURITY.md** - Security policy and vulnerability reporting
- **Issue Templates** - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
- **PR Template** - `.github/pull_request_template.md`

---

## 📐 Format Requirements by Document Type

### 1. ROADMAP.md

**Purpose**: Track high-level objectives and quarterly milestones.

**Required Structure**:

```markdown
# 🗺️ [Project Name] Roadmap

## Q[Quarter] [Year]: [Phase Name] ([Status]) [Emoji]

- [x] Completed item description
- [ ] Planned item description

## Q[Quarter] [Year]: [Next Phase] ([Status]) [Emoji]

- [ ] Future item
```

**CRITICAL RULES**:

- Use `## Q[Quarter] [Year]:` for quarter headers (e.g., `## Q4 2025:`)
- Status indicators in title: `(Completed)`, `(IN PROGRESS)`, `(Planned)`
- Use checkboxes: `[x]` for done, `[ ]` for not done
- Include emojis for visual clarity: 🚀 ✅ 🏗️ 🤖
- Keep descriptions concise (1-2 lines max per item)

**Parser Expectations**:

- Overseer parses `## Q` headers to identify quarters
- Checkbox status determines progress tracking
- Items under each quarter are grouped together

**Example**:

```markdown
# 🗺️ MyProject Roadmap

## Q4 2025: Foundation (Completed) 🚀

- [x] Initial project setup and architecture
- [x] Core API implementation
- [x] Basic authentication system

## Q1 2026: Feature Expansion (IN PROGRESS) 🏗️

- [x] User dashboard
- [ ] Advanced search functionality
- [ ] Export/import features
```

---

### 2. TASKS.md

**Purpose**: Track granular, actionable tasks by status.

**Required Structure**:

```markdown
# Tasks

## Done

- [x] Completed task description
- [x] Another completed task

## In Progress

- [ ] Currently working on this
- [ ] Also in progress

## Todo

- [ ] Future task
- [ ] Another future task

### [Optional Subsection]

- [ ] Grouped related tasks
```

**CRITICAL RULES**:

- **EXACTLY** these section names: `## Done`, `## In Progress`, `## Todo` (case-sensitive)
- Use checkboxes: `[x]` for Done, `[ ]` for In Progress and Todo
- Done items should have `[x]`, not `[ ]`
- Keep tasks actionable and specific
- Subsections under Todo (e.g., `### Phase 7: Security`) are allowed

**Parser Expectations**:

- Overseer ONLY recognizes these exact section names
- Tasks are grouped by section for display
- Checkbox state is visual only; section determines status

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:

- ❌ `### Todo` (wrong heading level)
- ❌ `## TODO` (wrong case)
- ❌ `## Completed` (wrong section name - use "Done")
- ❌ `[x]` in Todo section (inconsistent - should be `[ ]`)

**Example**:

```markdown
# Tasks

## Done

- [x] Set up project repository
- [x] Configure CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Write initial documentation

## In Progress

- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Design database schema

## Todo

### Phase 1: Core Features

- [ ] Build REST API
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Write API documentation

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

- [ ] WebSocket support
- [ ] GraphQL endpoint
```

---

### 3. METRICS.md

**Purpose**: Self-report project metrics for display in Overseer dashboard.

**Required Structure**:

```markdown
# Metrics

## Core Metrics

| Metric        | Value | Notes             |
| ------------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| Code Coverage | 85%   | Vitest unit tests |
| Build Time    | ~5s   | Local dev build   |
| Test Files    | 12    | Unit + E2E        |

## Health

| Metric       | Value      | Notes           |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| Open Issues  | 3          | GitHub issues   |
| Health Score | 92/100     | Overseer score  |
| Last Updated | 2025-11-27 | Last audit date |
```

**CRITICAL RULES**:

- Use markdown tables with `| Metric | Value | Notes |` format
- `Code Coverage` is extracted and displayed prominently - include percentage
- Keep sections: `## Core Metrics` and `## Health`
- Update `Last Updated` date when changing metrics
- **Use estimates when exact values unavailable** - prefix with `~` or note as "estimated"
- **Use TBD for unknown values** - don't invent numbers

**Getting Accurate Metrics**:

1. **Test Files Count**: Use `Get-ChildItem -Path "src" -Recurse -Filter "*.test.*" | Measure-Object` (PowerShell) or `find src -name "*.test.*" | wc -l` (Unix)
2. **Source Files Count**: Count TypeScript/JSX files excluding tests and type definitions
3. **Test Cases Count**: Run test suite and check output summary (e.g., "302 tests passing")
4. **Code Coverage**:
   - **ALWAYS run coverage tool to get actual percentage** - don't estimate or use TBD
   - Python: `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing tests/` (or `pytest -m "not slow" --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing` for fast tests)
   - Node/JS: `npm run test:coverage` or `npx vitest run --coverage`
   - Extract the overall percentage from coverage report output
   - Put detailed breakdowns in Notes column: `| Code Coverage | 86.66% | Overall branch coverage (pytest). Breakdown: module1 87%, module2 85% |`
5. **Build Time**: Note as "TBD" unless you can actually run build
6. **Bundle Size**: Note as "TBD" unless dist/ folder exists with build artifacts

**Parser Expectations**:

- Overseer extracts `Code Coverage` value and stores in database
- All metrics are displayed in detail panel
- Tables must have header row with separators

**Example**:

```markdown
# Metrics

## Core Metrics

| Metric          | Value | Notes                     |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------------------- |
| Code Coverage   | 92%   | Jest unit tests           |
| Build Time      | ~8s   | Production build          |
| Bundle Size     | 250KB | Gzipped                   |
| Test Files      | 18    | Unit, integration, E2E    |
| API Routes      | 24    | REST endpoints            |
| Database Tables | 6     | PostgreSQL                |
| Lines of Code   | 12.5K | Excluding tests/generated |

## Health

| Metric       | Value      | Notes                |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Open Issues  | 2          | GitHub issues        |
| Open PRs     | 1          | Under review         |
| Health Score | 95/100     | Overseer self-rating |
| Last Updated | 2025-11-27 | Last metrics refresh |
| Uptime       | 99.9%      | Last 30 days         |
```

### 4. FEATURES.md

**Purpose**: Document features organized by category with implementation status.

**Required Structure**:

```markdown
# [Project Name] Features

## [Category Name]

### 🔵 [Sub-Category or Feature Group]

- **Feature Name**: Description of the feature and what it does
- **Another Feature**: More details about this feature
```

**CRITICAL RULES**:

- Use `## [Category Name]` for top-level categories
- Use `### 🔵 [Sub-Category]` for feature groups
- Use `- **Feature Name**: Description` format for each feature
- Include emojis in sub-category headers for visual clarity
- Keep descriptions clear and concise (1-3 sentences)

**Parser Expectations**:

- Overseer extracts features by category
- Displays up to 3 category cards in detail panel
- Features are shown as bullet points under their category

**Example**:

```markdown
# MyProject Features

## Core Capabilities

### 🔐 Authentication & Security

- **OAuth Integration**: Support for GitHub, Google, and email-based authentication

For each file:
- If missing: Create from template with repository-specific content
- If exists: Preserve all unique content, fix format issues only
- If malformed: Restructure while keeping all information
```

### Step 3: Execute Updates

```text
1. Verify you're on correct feature branch (not main!)
2. Update files one at a time
3. Validate format after each change
4. Stage changes with git add
5. DO NOT commit automatically - let user review
6. Report what was changed and stage for user review
```

### Step 4: Validate & Stage for Review

```text
1. Check all required sections are present
2. Verify heading levels are correct
3. Confirm checkbox syntax is correct

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Hallucinate Content

- ❌ Don't invent features that don't exist
- ❌ Don't fabricate metrics or statistics
- ❌ Don't create fake roadmap items
- ✅ Use actual repository information
- ✅ Mark placeholders clearly: "TBD" or "Coming soon"

### Don't Blindly Apply Templates

- ❌ Don't replace existing ROADMAP with empty template
- ❌ Don't delete custom TASKS sections
- ❌ Don't overwrite specific metrics with generic ones
- ✅ Merge template structure with existing content
- ✅ Preserve all unique/custom information

### Don't Break Parser Expectations

- ❌ Don't use `## TODO` instead of `## Todo`
- ❌ Don't skip required section names
- ❌ Don't use wrong heading levels
- ✅ Follow exact section name requirements
- ✅ Use correct markdown syntax

### Don't Remove Custom Attributes

- ❌ Don't delete custom sections in TASKS.md (e.g., `### Phase 7`)
- ❌ Don't remove extra columns in METRICS.md tables
- ❌ Don't strip emoji or formatting that adds clarity
- ✅ Keep all custom content that doesn't break parsing
- ✅ Add to format, don't subtract from content

---

## 🔍 Repository-Specific Considerations

### For Web Applications

- Document API endpoints in FEATURES.md
- Include deployment instructions in README
- Track frontend/backend metrics separately in METRICS.md

### For Libraries/Packages

- Document API/exports in README
- Include usage examples
- Track adoption metrics if available

### For CLI Tools

- Document commands and flags in README
- Include installation methods (npm, brew, etc.)
- Track binary sizes in METRICS.md

### For Research/Experiments

- Focus on ROADMAP for experiment phases
- Document methodology in README
- Track experiment results in METRICS.md

### For Repositories with Detailed Existing Roadmap

**Challenge**: Repository has very detailed ROADMAP (500+ lines) with phases, timelines, estimated efforts

**Solution**:

1. **Create condensed Overseer-compliant version** at root (`ROADMAP.md`)
   - Extract high-level quarterly objectives
   - Convert to checkbox format with status indicators
   - Keep 1-2 lines per item maximum
   - Add status emojis (🚀, 🏗️, 💰, 📱)

2. **Preserve detailed version** in docs folder (`docs/ROADMAP_DETAILED.md`)
   - Move original detailed roadmap to docs/
   - Keep all phases, timelines, effort estimates, deliverables
   - Reference from condensed ROADMAP if needed

3. **Benefits of this approach**:
   - Overseer can parse quarterly structure
   - Detailed planning information preserved
   - Team still has access to full technical roadmap
   - Best of both worlds: compliance + detail

**Example transformation**:

```markdown
FROM (detailed, 700 lines):

## Phase 1: Foundation & Mobile Fix (v1.1)

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
**Goal:** Fix P0 bugs, establish maintainable architecture

### Week 1-2: Critical Mobile Fixes

#### 🔴 Mobile Touch Controls

**Problem:** Joysticks not responding...
**Tasks:**

- [ ] Add comprehensive touch event logging...
- [ ] Test on physical iOS devices...
      [continues for many lines]

TO (condensed, Overseer-compliant):

## Q4 2025: Foundation & Mobile Fix (IN PROGRESS) 🚀

- [x] Project structure and CI/CD pipeline setup
- [x] Basic multiplayer functionality
- [ ] Fix mobile touch controls
- [ ] Refactor Solo.tsx (1,002 lines → modular structure)
- [ ] Add server input validation and rate limiting
      [See docs/ROADMAP_DETAILED.md for full plan]
```

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Create new compliant ROADMAP.md from scratch
2. Move original to docs/ROADMAP_DETAILED.md
3. Extract key milestones and convert to checkbox format
4. Add cross-reference at bottom of condensed version

---

## ✅ Validation Checklist

- [ ] All required files exist
- [ ] Section names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- [ ] Heading levels are correct (## for major sections)
- [ ] Checkbox syntax is correct (`[x]` or `[ ]`)
- [ ] Tables have proper headers and separators
- [ ] No content was hallucinated
- [ ] All existing unique content was preserved
- [ ] Detailed content moved to docs/ folder if needed (not deleted)
- [ ] Changes are on a feature branch, not main
- [ ] Files are staged with git add (DO NOT commit)
- [ ] Summary of changes provided for user review

## 📚 Reference: Overseer's Health Score Components

Understanding what Overseer measures helps you prioritize documentation:

| Component             | Weight | What It Measures                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Documentation Health  | 30%    | Presence and health of 8 tracked docs                                                  |
| Testing & Quality     | 20%    | Test coverage, framework detection, CI/CD status                                       |
| Best Practices        | 20%    | 10 checks: CI/CD, linting, hooks, Docker, etc.                                         |
| Community Standards   | 15%    | 9 checks: CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, templates, CODEOWNERS, Copilot Instructions, etc. |
| Activity & Engagement | 15%    | Commit frequency, PR/Issue counts, contributor activity                                |

**Implication**: Focus first on the 8 tracked docs (README, ROADMAP, TASKS, METRICS, FEATURES, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING) as they have the highest impact on health scores.

### Critical Accuracy Requirements

When performing PM-driven documentation reviews:

1. **Use AUDIT.md as Source of Truth**
   - Before updating any doc, check docs/AUDIT.md for known inconsistencies
   - AUDIT.md tracks accurate counts, clarifications, and validation status
   - Update AUDIT.md when discovering new inconsistencies

2. **Verify Counts Against Implementation**
   - Community Standards: **9 checks** (CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, Issue Templates, PR Templates, CODEOWNERS, Copilot Instructions)
   - Fix Buttons: **21 total** (8 doc types, 4 best practices, 9 community standards - ALL standards are auto-fixable)
   - API Routes: Run `Get-ChildItem -Path "app/api" -Filter "route.ts" -Recurse` to count accurately
   - Always validate metrics against actual implementation

3. **Run Tests to Verify Metrics**
   - Code Coverage: Run `npx vitest run --coverage` to get accurate percentages
   - Use **overall repo average** for main metric value (e.g., "86.66%" for branch coverage)
   - Put detailed breakdowns in Notes column, not in Value column
   - Format: `| Code Coverage | 86.66% | Overall branch coverage (vitest). Breakdown: tasks.ts 87.5%, metrics.ts 85.29%, roadmap.ts 90% |`

4. **Distinguish Self-Reported vs. Own Metrics**
   - FEATURES.md "Code Coverage" feature = self-reported from target repositories
   - METRICS.md "Code Coverage" metric = Overseer's own test coverage
   - Add clarifications like "(self-reported from target repositories)" when ambiguous

5. **Systematic Review Process**
   - Follow order: ROADMAP → TASKS → FEATURES → METRICS → CHANGELOG
   - Mark tasks in todo list as in-progress/completed systematically
   - Cross-reference between docs for consistency
   - Validate final state against AUDIT.md checklist

6. **Document New Inconsistencies**
   - When discovering count mismatches, add to AUDIT.md tracking section
   - Mark status: ✅ Fixed, ⚠️ Clarified, ❌ Needs Fix
   - Include which docs were affected and what was corrected

## 🎓 Examples of Good vs. Bad Updates

### Example 1: TASKS.md Update

**❌ BAD** (Breaks parser):

```markdown
# Tasks

### Todo Items

- Implement feature X
- Fix bug Y

### Completed

- [x] Setup project
```

**✅ GOOD** (Follows format):

```markdown
# Tasks

## Done

- [x] Setup project
- [x] Configure development environment

## In Progress

- [ ] Implement feature X

## Todo

- [ ] Fix bug Y
- [ ] Add integration tests
```

### Example 2: ROADMAP.md Update

**❌ BAD** (Hallucinated content):

```markdown
# Roadmap

## Q4 2025

- [x] Launch to 1 million users
- [x] Achieve $10M ARR
- [ ] IPO preparation
```

**✅ GOOD** (Actual repository plans):

```markdown
# MyProject Roadmap

## Q4 2025: Initial Release (IN PROGRESS) 🚀

- [x] Core feature implementation
- [x] Basic test coverage
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Beta release

## Q1 2026: Feature Expansion (Planned) 🏗️

- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] API versioning
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
```

### Example 3: METRICS.md Update

**❌ BAD** (Fake metrics):

```markdown
| Metric        | Value | Notes            |
| ------------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| Code Coverage | 100%  | Perfect coverage |
| Performance   | 10x   | Super fast       |
```

**✅ GOOD** (Real or honest metrics):

```markdown
| Metric        | Value | Notes                    |
| ------------- | ----- | ------------------------ |
| Code Coverage | TBD   | Tests not yet written    |
| Build Time    | ~30s  | Needs optimization       |
| Test Files    | 2     | Basic smoke tests only   |
| Last Updated  | TBD   | Awaiting initial release |
```

## 🔄 Documentation Maintenance Workflow

**Purpose**: Keep documentation clean, organized, and up-to-date by regularly consolidating completed tasks and maintaining consistency across all documentation files.

### The Move and Collapse Pattern

This workflow prevents documentation bloat and ensures completed work is properly recognized while keeping task lists actionable:

#### Step 1: Consolidate Completed Tasks

**When**: TASKS.md Done section has many items (50+) that are cluttering the file

**Process**:

1. **Review the Done section** - Look at all completed tasks and identify themes/groups
2. **Organize by completion period** - Group items by time period (e.g., "November 2025", "Q4 2025")
3. **Organize by feature area** - Group related items under descriptive subsections
4. **Collapse to summaries** - Replace long lists with organized groups and references

**Example**:

```markdown
## Done

### Recent Completions (November 2025)

#### Feature Audit & Documentation

- Documentation Accuracy Audit (100% coverage)
- PROMPT.md creation with agent instructions
- Template health detection implementation
- See FEATURES.md and CHANGELOG.md for full details

#### Advanced Metrics & Analytics

- Contributor Analytics (count, bus factor, PR merge time)
- CI/CD build status integration
- Vulnerability tracking (Dependabot alerts)
- LOC and test case counting
- See ROADMAP.md Q4 2025 Contributor Analytics section

### Core Features (Q4 2025)

- Health Score 2.0 with 5-component calculation
- Documentation Management (templates, auto-fix, batch operations)
- Repository Dashboard with filtering and stats
- AI-Powered Summaries (Gemini integration)
- See FEATURES.md for comprehensive list
```

**Key Points**:

- Replace individual task checkboxes with descriptive summaries
- Include references to FEATURES.md, CHANGELOG.md, ROADMAP.md for full details
- Keep subsections organized by time period or feature area
- Maintain enough detail that someone can understand what was accomplished

#### Step 2: Migrate to FEATURES.md

**When**: Completed tasks represent substantial features that should be documented

**Process**:

1. **Review collapsed Done items** - Identify which represent features vs. minor tasks
2. **Check FEATURES.md** - See if feature already exists; if not, add it
3. **Add to appropriate category** - Place feature under relevant section
4. **Include implementation details** - Expand beyond task description with feature capabilities

**Example**:

```markdown
### 📝 Documentation Management

- **Standardized Templates**: ROADMAP.md, TASKS.md, METRICS.md, FEATURES.md, and community standards templates
- **Agent Instructions (PROMPT.md)**: Comprehensive guide for AI agents to update repository documentation while maintaining Overseer compliance and avoiding hallucination
- **Auto-Fix Missing Docs**: One-click PR creation for missing documentation
- **Batch Operations**: Fix all missing docs across repositories with single PR
- **Doc Health Scoring**: Percentage-based health scores for documentation completeness
- **Template Health Detection**: Content hashing to identify unchanged/dormant templates
```

**Key Points**:

- Transform task descriptions into feature descriptions
- Add context about what the feature does and why it's valuable
- Use bold feature names followed by colon and description
- Group related features under descriptive subsections

#### Step 3: Check Todo Section

**When**: After consolidating Done section

**Process**:

1. **Review Todo section** - Check if there are actionable tasks
2. **If Todo has tasks** - Stop here, don't pull from ROADMAP
3. **If Todo is empty or nearly empty** - Proceed to Step 4

**Rationale**: Only pull from ROADMAP when there's actually capacity. If Todo already has work, focus on completing that first.

#### Step 4: Pull from ROADMAP (Only if Todo Empty)

**When**: Todo section is empty or has very few items (< 5)

**Process**:

1. **Review ROADMAP.md** - Look for next planned items not yet started
2. **Identify actionable tasks** - Find items that can be broken down into concrete tasks
3. **Break down into tasks** - Convert high-level roadmap items into specific, actionable tasks
4. **Add to Todo** - Place new tasks in Todo section
5. **Keep ROADMAP item unchecked** - Don't mark ROADMAP items as complete until actually done

**Example**:

ROADMAP.md has:

```markdown
## Future: Security Enhancements 🔐

- [ ] Security Detail: Track 6 GitHub security configuration settings
  - [ ] Security policy - Define vulnerability reporting process
  - [ ] Dependabot alerts - Dependency vulnerability counter/link
```

Add to TASKS.md:

```markdown
## Todo

### Phase 9: Security Configuration Tracking

- [ ] Add security config API integration
- [ ] Parse security policy presence
- [ ] Track Dependabot alert count and display
- [ ] Add security score to health calculation
- [ ] Display security config in dashboard
```

**Key Points**:

- Break ROADMAP items into multiple concrete tasks
- Keep ROADMAP items unchecked until feature is complete
- Only pull what's realistically achievable in next phase
- Don't duplicate ROADMAP content; reference it instead

#### Step 5: Update ROADMAP.md

**When**: After major feature completions or phase changes

**Process**:

1. **Review quarter sections** - Check which quarters have all items completed
2. **Update status markers** - Change from `(IN PROGRESS)` to `(COMPLETED)` when all items done
3. **Add completion dates** - Note month/year when phase was completed
4. **Reorganize future items** - Move incomplete items to appropriate future sections
5. **Do NOT remove items** - Keep completed items visible in ROADMAP

**Example**:

Before:

```markdown
## Q4 2025: Contributor Analytics & Enterprise Features (IN PROGRESS) 🏗️

- [x] Template Health Detection
- [x] Contributor Analytics
- [x] Bus Factor Analysis
- [ ] GitHub OAuth Production Fix
- [ ] Security in Health Score
```

After:

```markdown
## Q4 2025: Contributor Analytics & Enterprise Features (COMPLETED) ✅

- [x] Template Health Detection (November 2025)
- [x] Contributor Analytics (November 2025)
- [x] Bus Factor Analysis (November 2025)

## Future: Production Deployment & Security Enhancements 🔐

- [ ] GitHub OAuth Production Fix
- [ ] Security in Health Score
```

**Key Points**:

- Keep completed items in ROADMAP for historical record
- Update status in section title when phase is complete
- Move incomplete items to appropriate future sections
- Add completion dates to individual items

#### Step 6: Update CHANGELOG.md

**When**: Significant features or versions are completed

**Process**:

1. **Group changes by type** - Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security
2. **Move Unreleased to version** - When releasing, move Unreleased content to version section
3. **Add version number and date** - Use semantic versioning
4. **Keep descriptions user-facing** - Focus on what changed, not how

**Example**:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Documentation maintenance workflow guide
- Enhanced PROMPT.md with workflow instructions

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-27

### Added

- Contributor Analytics: Track contributor count, bus factor, and PR merge time
- CI/CD Status Integration: Display build status in dashboard
- Template Health Detection: Identify stale/dormant documentation templates
- Agent Instructions (docs/PROMPT.md): Comprehensive guide for AI documentation updates

### Changed

- Updated Gemini API to use 2.5 models (deprecated 1.x models)
- Improved health score calculation with 5 weighted components

### Fixed

- Fixed Community Standards count from 7 to 8 checks
```

---

### Workflow Summary

```text
1. CONSOLIDATE (TASKS.md Done) → Organize completed tasks into themed groups
2. MIGRATE (→ FEATURES.md) → Add substantial features to feature documentation
3. CHECK (TASKS.md Todo) → If empty or nearly empty, proceed to step 4
4. PULL (ROADMAP → TASKS.md Todo) → Break down next roadmap items into tasks
5. UPDATE (ROADMAP.md) → Mark phases complete, reorganize incomplete items
6. LOG (CHANGELOG.md) → Document user-facing changes by version
```

### Frequency

- **CONSOLIDATE**: When Done section has 50+ items
- **MIGRATE**: After consolidation, when features are complete
- **CHECK**: After every consolidation
- **PULL**: Only when Todo is empty (< 5 items)
- **UPDATE**: When phases are complete or quarterly
- **LOG**: When releasing versions or major features

### Key Principles

1. **Preserve History**: Don't delete completed ROADMAP items
2. **Maintain Accuracy**: Only document what actually exists
3. **Keep Context**: Include references between documents
4. **Stay Actionable**: Todo should have clear, achievable tasks
5. **Respect Format**: Follow all Overseer parsing requirements
6. **Document Workflow**: Update this guide when workflow evolves
7. **Track UX Improvements**: When discovering UX issues during development, add them to ROADMAP as "Future: UX Enhancements"

## 🎯 Documenting Error Handling & UX Improvements

**New Pattern Learned**: When implementing error handling or UX improvements, document them comprehensively.

### When Adding Error Handling

If you create error detection/handling systems:

1. **FEATURES.md** - Add to appropriate category (e.g., "Documentation Management" or "Authentication & Security")
   - List error types detected (OAuth restrictions, permissions, rate limits, etc.)
   - Describe user-facing improvements (auto-redirect, toast notifications, instructions)
   - Include both technical features (error parsing) and UX features (helpful messaging)

2. **CHANGELOG.md** - Document in [Unreleased] section
   - Added: New error detection systems, documentation, utilities
   - Changed: Error messages, UX flows
   - Fixed: Specific error scenarios that now work better

3. **ROADMAP.md** - If discovering new UX issues during implementation
   - Add "Future: UX Enhancements" section for follow-up improvements
   - Example: Modal previews, confirmation dialogs, pick-and-choose functionality

4. **TASKS.md** - Move error handling work to Done
   - Consolidate multiple related tasks into summary items
   - Include both implementation and documentation work

5. **AUDIT.md** - Add to Feature Detection & Display Matrix
   - New row section: "Error Handling & UX"
   - List detection methods, sources, health indicators
   - Mark status as Complete when implemented

6. **METRICS.md** - Track new files/utilities created
   - Add rows for new utility files (e.g., lib/github-errors.ts)
   - Add rows for new documentation (e.g., OAuth guides)

### Example: OAuth Error Handling Documentation

**What we implemented:**

- lib/github-errors.ts (error parsing utility)
- Enhanced API error responses in fix-doc/fix-best-practice endpoints
- Auto-redirect to GitHub authorization page
- Toast notifications with instructions
- Two user guides (GITHUB_OAUTH_ORG_ACCESS.md, OAUTH_ORG_FIX_SUMMARY.md)

**How we documented it:**

```markdown
FEATURES.md:

- **OAuth Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection...
- **GitHub Error Parsing**: Detects 5 error types...
- **Authorization Auto-Redirect**: Automatically opens...
- **Error Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance...

CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]:

### Added

- **OAuth Error Handling System:** Comprehensive error detection...
- **GitHub Error Parsing:** Detects 5 error types...

ROADMAP.md Future:

- [ ] Doc Fix Preview Modal: Modal window before PR creation...

TASKS.md Done:

- [x] OAuth error handling: Comprehensive error parsing...
- [x] Error detection system: Created lib/github-errors.ts...

AUDIT.md:
| **Error Handling & UX** |
| OAuth Error Detection | Error message pattern matching | ✅ Complete
```

This pattern ensures:

1. Users understand new features (FEATURES.md)
2. Changes are tracked historically (CHANGELOG.md)
3. Future improvements are planned (ROADMAP.md)
4. Work is marked complete (TASKS.md)
5. Implementation is audited (AUDIT.md)
6. New files are tracked (METRICS.md)

## 🤖 Agent Self-Check Questions

Before staging documentation updates for user review, ask yourself:

1. **Did I read the entire codebase?** → Understanding prevents hallucination
2. **Is this content specific to THIS repository?** → Generic = bad
3. **Did I preserve all existing unique content?** → Don't delete custom info
4. **Are section names EXACTLY correct?** → Parser depends on exact matches
5. **Would a human maintainer approve this?** → Quality check
6. **Can Overseer parse this successfully?** → Format validation
7. **Am I on a feature branch?** → Never work on main directly
8. **Did I STAGE but NOT COMMIT changes?** → User must review first
9. **Did I preserve detailed docs in docs/ folder?** → Don't delete, relocate
10. **Did I provide clear summary of changes?** → User needs to understand what changed

---

## 📝 Best Practices for Compliance Updates

### DO ✅

1. **Preserve all existing content** - Move to docs/ if needed, never delete
2. **Use actual metrics** - Count files, run tests, check real values
3. **Estimate clearly** - Mark with `~` or "estimated" when needed
4. **Stage for review** - Use `git add`, let user commit
5. **Create backup versions** - Save detailed docs before condensing
6. **Cross-reference** - Link condensed docs to detailed versions
7. **Be specific** - Repository-specific content beats generic templates
8. **Test commands** - Verify PowerShell/bash commands work in that environment

### DON'T ❌

1. **Don't auto-commit** - User must review before commit
2. **Don't auto-push** - User controls when changes go to remote
3. **Don't hallucinate metrics** - Use "TBD" if you don't know
4. **Don't delete detailed content** - Preserve in docs/ folder
5. **Don't blindly apply templates** - Merge with existing content
6. **Don't invent features** - Document what actually exists
7. **Don't skip validation** - Check format requirements before staging
8. **Don't work on main branch** - Always use feature branches

---

## 📞 When in Doubt

If you're unsure about:

- **Format requirements** → Reference this document and existing Overseer docs
- **Repository-specific content** → Read the codebase thoroughly
- **What to include** → Include more context rather than less
- **Custom sections** → Keep them if they don't break parsing
- **Metric values** → Use "TBD" rather than inventing numbers

**Remember**: It's better to mark something as "TBD" or "Coming soon" than to hallucinate content that doesn't exist.
